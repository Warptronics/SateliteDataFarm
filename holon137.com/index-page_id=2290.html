						<p><strong>Physicists and Mystics as Human Observers</strong></p>
<p>The sets of quotations below from well-known physicists and mystics can easily be the interchange to represent the voices of the mystics or the voices of the physicists, since both inner (inside the logic-information vacuum) and outer realities (inside the 3-dimensional space) are interchangeable for quantum observer in Matter-Bing / Being-Matter interactions. In the words of a psychologist, Lawrence LeShan:</p>
<p>“<em>The physicist and the mystic follow different paths: they have different technical goals in view; they use different tools and methods; their attitudes are not the same. However, in the world-picture … they perceive the same basic structure, the same reality. As Fritjof Capra, a physicist, concluded: In contrast to the mystic, the physicist …by studying the material world. Penetrating into ever-deeper realms of matter, he has become aware of the essential unity of all things and events. More than that, he has also learnt that he himself and his consciousness are an integral part of this unity. Thus the mystic and the physicist arrived at the same conclusion; one starting from the inner realm, the other from the outer world. … the reality within.”</em></p>
<p>The physicists observe reality through their instrumentations constructed with their beliefs in the “so called laws of Nature”. The mystics observe reality through their psychic visions constructed in their “so called laws of the spirit world embedded in the Philosopher’s Stone”. What they both observed are the inner-outer actions at the spirit-brain and/or soul-brain crossovers, recorded and executed in God’s self-programming vacuum computer. The physicists’ instruments are energy-information teleportation operators, while the mystics’ psychic visions are logic-information produced by the actions of their souls and spirits via the observer’s mind. The Matter-Being Paradigm has to do with understanding the encoded logic-execution of the bio-quantum in God’s computer at these two singularity crossovers. The Observer–Crossover singularity connection, in the Observer’s State of Mind, is the Holon</p>
<p><strong>Eureka–Bless–Pure Love</strong></p>
<p>This type of knowing, in scientific discovery or left-brain awareness is referred to as an Ah Ha, or Eureka, or the moment of creativity or discovery. In “Messengers of Paradise,” Charles Levinthal has this to say about this moment of discovery in science and in creative experiences.</p>
<p><em>There is an essential commonality between the process of discovery in the sciences and the creative experience in other human endeavors. One connecting thread seems to be what psychologist Jerome Bruner once called the phenomenon of “effective surprise.” In 1962 he proposed that this element was the hallmark of the creative enterprise, no matter where or when it occurs. … Through effective surprise, there is a new placement, perhaps merely a rearrangement that yields in the end a new perspective, so that we can be transported beyond the everyday ways of experiencing the world. As a result, the world is changed, never to be quite the same again.</em></p>
<p>One of the most vivid accounts of this moment of creativity in a scientist’s life was expressed by scientist-novelist C.P. Snow. Here is how one of his characters reflected upon the moment of his particular insight:</p>
<p>Then I was carried beyond pleasure … My own triumph and delight and success were there, but they seemed insignificant beside this tranquil ecstasy. It was as though I had looked for a truth outside myself, and finding it had become for a moment a part of the truth I sought, as though all the world, the atoms and the stars, were wonderfully clear, and close to me, and I to them, so that we were part of a lucidity more tremendous than any mystery.<br />
I had never known that such a moment could exist. … Since then I have never quite regained it. But one effect will stay with me as long as I live; once, when I was young, I used to sneer at the mystics who have described the experience of being at one with God and part of the unity of things. After that afternoon, I did not want to laugh again; for though I should have interpreted the experience differently. I thought I knew what they meant.</p>
<p><strong>This Ah Ha, or Eureka Momont, or the moment of discovery is teleported to a “place” outside of time, space, and matter as summarized in “Messengers of Paradise.” This place is at the singularity crossover</strong></p>
<p>Csikszentmihalyi has pointed out, in his analysis of the phenomenon, that it is during these moments that there is typically a temporary loss of ego. These are intervals when we seem to ignore the needs of our body; we go without sleep, without food and drink, as we get caught up in a private euphoria that we sometimes wish would never end. It is a kind of Paradise of our own internal making, and we discover that time seems to have stood still. A composer once expressed it in this way:<br />
You yourself are in an ecstatic state to such a point that you feel as though you almost don’t exist. I’ve experienced this time and time again. My hand seems devoid of myself, and I have nothing to do with what is happening. I just sit there watching it in a state of awe and wonderment. And it just flows out by itself.</p>
<p>Or as a world-class chess player put the feeling:<br />
Time passes a hundred times faster. In this sense, it resembles the dream state. A whole story can unfold in seconds, it seems.</p>
<p>Above all, the essential ingredient of the flow experience is that it appears to need no foals or rewards external to it. The passion toward doing what one feels has to be done can override the hope of material success, the pain that may have to be undergone in the process, or the danger that might exist.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, I discovered God (I mean God’s Self-Programmable Computer) inside the process of this research on the Holon theory of everything.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p><strong> Experiments in quantum physics, nano-chemistry, nano-biology, para-psychology, etc. together with the metaphysical experiments such as pulse and acu-point readings, radionics, psychic viewing, occult chemistry, and so on are necessary in obtaining an understanding of this Matter-Being Reality. In this website and the book, the combined experimental data in a, top-down (ancient right brain)/bottom-up (modern left brain), integrated way were used in the development of this paradigm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Game on the Meanings of Reality:</strong><br />
Try to determine which of the following 32 quotations were written by mystics and which were written by physicists. The answers are posted at the end of these quotations.</p>
<p>It is the mind, which gives to things their quality, their foundation, their being. [1]</p>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, that advancing knowledge should base herself on a clear, pure and disciplined intellect. It is necessary, too, that she should correct her errors, sometimes by a return to the restraint of sensible fact, the concrete realities of the physical world. The touch of Earth is always reinvigorating to the Sons of Earth. … It may even be said that the super-physical can only be really mastered in its fullness … when we keep our feet firmly on the physical. [2]</p>
<p>Where there is duality, as it were, there one sees the other. But where everything is one&#8217;s own self, then whom would one see? [3]</p>
<p>The stuff of the world is mind-stuff [4]</p>
<p>The development of atomic physics, which forces us to an attitude toward the problem of explanation recalling ancient wisdom, that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and spectators. [5]</p>
<p>The Absolute [is] everything that exists… This Absolute has become the universe [as we perceive it] by coming through time, space and causation. … Time, space and causation are like the glass through which the Absolute is seen, and when it is seen … it appears as the universe. Now we at once gather from this, that in the Absolute, there is neither time, space nor causation… What we call causation begins after, if we may be permitted to say so, the degeneration of the Absolute into the phenomenal and not before.[6]</p>
<p>Man disposes himself and construes this disposition as the world. [7]</p>
<p>The first kind of reality is absolute; it is the existence of one&#8217;s consciousness. The second kind of reality comprises the existence of everything else, in particular the concepts in it. One very often forgets about consciousness as a reality because of too much concern with the external world. [8]</p>
<p>Thus the material world…constitutes the whole world of appearance, but not the world of reality; we may think of it as forming a cross section of the world of reality. [9]</p>
<p>And so today I build in space my own roadways from there to there and back, where I enjoy the advantage of living in two worlds at once—the mundane world and the world “out-there” where the sun never sets and adventure lurks in every breath, where destiny and free-will meet, and like past and future are irrevocably wedded. [10]</p>
<p>The river and its waves are one surf: where is the difference between the river and its waves?<br />
When the wave rises, it is the water; and when it falls, it is the same water again. Tell me, Sir, where is the distinction? [11]</p>
<p>That which is nothing-ness! And yet itself is everything-ness. Everything-ness … produces [the duality] … Motion and rest alternate, each being the root of the other. [12]</p>
<p>Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the Infinite. [13]</p>
<p>As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, they do not refer to reality. …Pure logical thinking cannot yield us any knowledge of the empirical world; all knowledge of reality starts from experience and ends in it. Propositions arrived at by pure logical means are completely empty. [14]</p>
<p>The mind has by its selective power fitted the processes of Nature into a frame of law of a pattern largely of its own choosing; and in the discovery of this system of law the mind may be regarded as regaining from Nature that which the mind has put into Nature. [15]</p>
<p>For our experiments are not nature itself, but a nature changed and transformed by our activity in the course of research. [16]</p>
<p>The reason why our sentient, percipient, and thinking ego is met nowhere in our world picture can easily be indicated in seven words: because it is ITSELF that world picture. It is identical with the whole and therefore cannot be contained in it. [17]</p>
<p>There are indeed fundamentally two categories of knowledge—knowledge by Ideation and Knowledge by Being. All scientific knowledge, whether physical or super-physical, belongs to the first category. Such knowledge is based on the duality of the observer and observed. In spiritual perception, however, there is Knowledge by Being—it arises in that state where the duality of the observer and the observed has vanished. [18]</p>
<p>… illuminated appears to be obscure … advancing appears to be retreating. It is the form of the formless; the image of nothingness. [19]</p>
<p>Things do not struggle among themselves at random. They flow of necessity from their principle of order. They are integrated by a root cause. They are gathered together by a single influence. Thus things are complex but not chaotic. There is multiplicity of them but not confusion. [20]</p>
<p>It seems to me that God in the beginning formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable particles of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties, and in such proportions to space as most to conduce to the end of which He formed them; and that these primitive particles being solids, are incomparably harder than any porous body compounded of them; even so very hard as never to wear or break to pieces; no ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made in the first creation. [21]</p>
<p>The objective world simply is, it does not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling along the life-line of my body, does a fleeting image in space, which continually changes in time. [22]</p>
<p>Perception here means seeing in the light that is in time, for anything I think of I think of in the light that is in time and temporal. But angels perceive in the light that is beyond time and eternal. They know in the eternal now. … Yet take away this now of time and thou art everywhere and hast the whole of time. [23]</p>
<p>[Describing electron motion] There is a kind of circular motion. Oh yes, there is, a circular motion along the little bit of the beam, which is within my sight. I can’t get away from that. It’s just as if the pencil of beam continued its steady condition but there is associated with it a distinct thickening and thinning going on and it’s a wavelike condition. [24]</p>
<p>[Describing electron motion] The spinning is immense; the shape isn’t maintained all the time. It swells and it goes down, like a centrifugal force makes it swell out, then something else makes it swell in. It’s pulsing. It’s … it’s lighted, very brilliantly lighted. [25]</p>
<p>In modern mechanics … it is impossible to obtain an adequate version of the laws for which we are looking, unless the physical system is regarded as a whole. According to modern mechanics, each individual particle of the system, in a certain sense, at any one time, exist simultaneously in every part of the space occupied by the system. This simultaneous existence applies not merely to the field of force, with which it is surrounded, but also its mass and its charge. [26]</p>
<p>These two ways of thinking, the way of time and history and the way of eternity and timelessness, are both parts of man’s effort to comprehend the world in which he lives. Neither is comprehended in the other nor reducible to it. They are, as we have learned to say in physics, complementary views, each supplementing the other, neither telling the whole story. [27]</p>
<p>A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the “Universe,” a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security. [28]</p>
<p>You are both question and answer. You are the total consciousness for which you seek, but bound by life’s many experiences. One thing must be clear to you: there is no interruption; the experiences and you are the same. [29]</p>
<p>In space-time, everything which for each of us constitutes the past, the present and the future is given in block, and the entire collection of events, successive for each of us which forms the existence of a material particle is represented by a line, the world line of the particle. … Each observer, as his time passes, discovers, so to speak, new slices of space-time, which appear to him as successive aspects of the material world, though in reality the ensemble of events constituting space-time exist prior to his knowledge of them. [30]</p>
<p>All things physical are information theoretic in origin … It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom—at a very deep bottom, in most instances—an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that things physical are information-theoretic in origin. [31]</p>
<p>[One can acquire] knowledge of the small, the hidden or the distant by directing the light of superphysical faculty. [32]</p>
