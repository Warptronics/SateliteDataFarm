				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chakra Health connected to spiritual development and kundalini fire  were discussed in the previous three postings: </strong><em>What are the Paths of  Kundalini, </em><strong>and</strong> <em>What are the Kundalini Fire Symptoms,</em> <strong>plus</strong> <em>What is the Path toward Enlightenment. </em><strong>Causal Chain Physiology was also diagramed in posting, </strong><em>What is Spirit-Causal Physiology</em>. <strong>Putting them all together, we have the following brief-summary diagram.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FLOW DIAGRAM ON HEALTH IN GENERAL</strong></p>
<p><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-4121" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=4121"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4121" title="tem-2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/tem-29.jpeg" alt="tem-2" width="421" height="361" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gland Holon Connections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pineal—Hypothalamus—Thymus &#8212;&gt; Depression-Heart attack dominate<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong> Thyroid—Ovaries/Uterus/Testes—Adrenal<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pituitary&#8211;Adrenal&#8211;Thyroid &#8212;&gt; Stress-Stroke dominate<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notice the Pineal and Pituitary Glands are connected by the Hypothalamus. Not shown in the diagram are the neuro connections to the endocrines<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The bottom part of the diagram depicts the answer to What Cause Physical Health. First, the simple Cause Chain of Physical Health. In general this Cause Chain is separated, yet connected in two branches: (1) Ht&#8211;Lu&#8211;Ki Health and Ht&#8211;Lv&#8211;Ki Health. The difference between these two branches is Lu (Pasteur-Germ Concept) versus Lv (Bechamp-Fermenation Concept). </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE CAUSAL CHAINS IN BOTH SIDES ARE INTERCONNECTED, AS SHOWN IN THE  DIAGRAM; THUS BECHAMP AND PASTEUR CONCEPTS ARE INTERCONNECTED</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BOTH SIDES ARE INTERCONNECTED BY THE ACU-POINT MERIDIAN HOLOH: FIRE (Ht)&#8212;WATER (Ki)&#8212;SPINE (Bl)<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice, the concepts of Fire (on top) and Water (on bottom) in Chinese 5-Element physiology are different from the Fire (on bottom) and Water (on top) concepts in Tridosha as presented earlier under Kundalini Fire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another view is from their Causes; namely the Holon of Eating (food, drug, etc)&#8212;Responds to Sudden Changes in Weather or Habits&#8212;Over Sex. In this Holon, the major cause is Over-Eating, which follows the Fermenation&#8212;Bacteria&#8212;Blood concept of Bechamp.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Over Weight</span> is a health problem with the Holon<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pituitary&#8211;Adrenal&#8211;Thyroid &#8212;-&gt; Imbalance / out of Control<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> and must be corrected via the WebHealth Computer. On the other hand, maintaining a steady state in Weight can be accomplished, as shown in the diagram, by the following equation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Food Intakes = Digestion + Waste Output</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In fact, this equation also applies to maintaining a healthy eating habit. What is Healthy Eating, or Eating Healthy Foods? Healthy Eating can only be defined for an individual together with the individual&#8217;s understanding of his or her causal path. As discussed earlier, the healthy foods or correct type of foods for an individual together with one&#8217;s causal path must be developed through one&#8217;s feelings-symptoms (see next posting: </strong><em>What is the Correct Meditation</em>). <strong>As described earlier, an easier way to learn these feedings-symptoms is via the WebHealth Computer.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Although each individual has his or her steady state physiological condition, there exists a universal set of optimum steady state metabolic rates. This optimum set is</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Respiration = 18 cycles/min &lt;&#8212; (2 x 9)<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Temperature = 36 degree C &lt;&#8212; (4 x 9)<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pulse = 72 cycles / min &lt;&#8212; (8 X 9)<br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>With its base rhythm of 9 cycles / min defined for the Craniosacral Fluid oscillation, this set defines the harmony between the octaves of mind-soul / mind-spirit and the breath of the universe. This set can therefore be taken as the optimum physiological rates, the final goal for spiritual enlightenment training.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Organ Side Dominates<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> In addition, this cause of over eating connects to Ck-3, which has to do with the entire 12-organ meridians as viewed in the Five-Element theory (see diagram in previous posting). Thus, depending on the Causal Path of the Individual, the cause of Over-Eating / </strong><strong>Fermentation </strong><strong>can generates symptoms of Chronic Fatigue, Fibromyalgia, or Arthritis. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Endocrine Side Dominate<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the case of drug, its cause can also effect the Endocrine side, which causes Stress and/or Depression. Kundalini Fire (discussed in a previous posting) is connected to this side. The reason why the Pasteur-Germ concept is placed on this side of the diagram is because of its connection to the Lu. In fact, the causal path that involves the Lu is covered in the Weather Effect on Health.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weather&#8212;Sex</span>: For the Health Problems connected to the Weather Holon (Sun) Magnetic Storm&#8212;Zodiac Phases&#8212;Moon Phases see the Book, </strong><em>The Matter-Being Project: Putting Mind-Soul-Spirit into Physics-Chemistry-Genetics-Technology</em>. <strong>Instead, we shall discuss a general health problem involving the with response time to sudden (extreme) changes in Weather, Individual daily habit, and others. This particular health problem is caused by the individual&#8217;s physiology, his inability to respond in time to adopt to these sudden changes, especially for the weak, the old, and the sick. For these individuals, this problem (although not life frightening) occurs very often. Sex, the last component in the Holon Eating&#8212;Weather &#8212; Sex has been thoroughly discussed in connection with Kundalini fire.</strong></p>
