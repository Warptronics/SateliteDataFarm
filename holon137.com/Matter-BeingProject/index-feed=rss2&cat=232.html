				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE SECOND THREE DAYS OF CREATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Fourth Day of Creation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons and for days, and years.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[Let there be the logic of outer light (&#8211;&gt; 36 to 72 Octaves), and this logic expressed in the form of yin-yang bigrams arranged into the logic of seasons.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-4362" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=4362"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4362" title="tem-2 2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tem-2-21.jpeg" alt="tem-2 2" width="359" height="128" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And let them be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth; and it was so.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[Let the logic of free will neutral line be added to the yin-yang trigram to form tetragram of the Z boson to light the earth&#8217;s spirit; and it was so.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; He made the stars also.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[And God made two great lights; the greater light, the photon with the neutral line, to rule the day spirit, and the lesser light, the boson tetragrams</strong> <strong>to rule the soul of the night, and with pure love, the graviton pentagram logic formed with two photons added to the yin-yang trigram. In the yin&#8212;yang&#8212;neutral line diagram logic, He created the galaxies.</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were into the fourth day.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[And God Created the Logic of Involution with the firmament, namely the light-Photons in the three octave levels, and thus completed the Involution Logic of Matter.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Fifth Day of Creation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and God saw that it was good.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[God Created the Involution Logic of Life in correspondence to the Involution Logic of Matter.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruiful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas; and let fowl multiply in the earth.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[God created the post-heaven, key logic octagon that is in symmetry to the pre-heaven logic octagon.</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And the evening and the morning were the fifth </em>day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Sixth Day of Creation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind; and so it was&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[God on the sixth day, completed the creation of Matter-Being Lock-Key Involution Logic of the Universe. Thus, in this second three days, the set of key logic represented by the post-heaven octagon is encoded with the pre-heaven octagon lock logic in the thought octagon. Remember that these Six Days of creation were completed within a non-local set of logic before space and before time. Thus, the entire Six Days of Creation occurred simultaneously in God&#8217;s free will and encoded in the thought-octagon</strong> <strong>outside space and outside time. This Creation is in the Logic and Information Vacuums and is encoded in the Self-Programmable Computer</strong> <strong>by the Thought Octagon.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE SEVENTH DAY REST</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BIG BANG<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LOCK-KEY SYMMETRY BREAKS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Thus the heavens and he earth were finished, and all the host of them.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>[The logic of the pre-heaven and the post-heaven octagons were finished and encoded in the thought octagon, and thus the logic component of Matter-Being was created and encoded in the computer. He put them inside the Base-9 world and into the logic set of the number 9 and waited for the entanglements to self-create within its members. Within the Base-9 world of numbers, the logic of motion is created in the Gnomonic expansion&#8212;contraction&#8212;spiral Holon. And within the logic of motion, Base-10 plus space and the physical constants are created.<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> In this logic set of the number 9, there exist lock-key subsets of (8, 1), (7, 2), (6, 3), and (5, 4). In addition, two series are formed in this logic set of the number 9. These series are </strong></p>

<p><strong>The first series is related to the Music of the Sphere and to Gurdjieff&#8217;s Enneagram.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Music of the Sphere: 4, 8, (2 x 8= 16-&gt;) 7, (2 x 16= 32-&gt;) 5, (2 x 32 = 64-&gt;) 1, (2 x 64 = 128-&gt;) 2 &#8230; In Base-9 summation: 4 + 8 + 7+ 5+ 1+ 2 = 27 = 2 + 7 &#8211;&gt; 9 and the sum of the second series, 3 + 6 + 9 = 18 = 1 + 8 &#8211;&gt; 9<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gurdjieff: 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7, 1, 4, 8, 5, 7, &#8230; In Gurdjieff&#8217;s (Base-10) analysis, 1/7 = .142857&#8230;, 2/7 = .285714&#8230;, 3/7 = .42857&#8230;, 4/7 = .571428&#8230;, 5/7 =.714285&#8230;, 6/7 = .857142&#8230;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(See Wing Pon&#8217;s <em>Neo-Taoism,</em>Vol II)<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>God Created the Base-9 world inside the Pre-Heaven Octagon and  the Base-10 World inside the Post-Heaven Octagon. God then bind these two worlds together in arithmetic-series / geometric-series and encoded in the vacuum computer with the corresponding Involution line-diagram Logic for the Universe&#8217;s Computer. (See posting, <em>How Light Constant derived other Physical Constants</em>) This Creation is perfect, as defined by the Holon of Beauty&#8212;Symmetry&#8212;Economical in Action.]</strong></p>
<p><em>And on the seventh day God ended his work, which he had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</em></p>
<p><strong>[And on the seventh day, God rested; and watched the breaks in symmetry, namely, in its beauty and its economical actions (least actions). This break is caused internally by the entangled free wills, namely the free wills inputted into all  of God&#8217;s Creation. Notice, God&#8217;s Created the Involution Logic for this universe with one set of free will, which is God&#8217;s Free Will. Yet each Being He Created has its, his, her own free will, with its, his, or her own frame of reference; therefore entanglements or conflicts among free wills are bound to happen (for example, in the interpretations of Beauty and Enconomy). In short, God created free will and cause a small infinitesimal imperfection in the interpretation of  His 3&#8212;6&#8212;9 Involution Logic.] </strong></p>
