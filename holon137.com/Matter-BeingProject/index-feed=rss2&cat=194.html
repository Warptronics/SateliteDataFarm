ANSWERS PROVIDED FOR THE 11 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN PHYSICS. ALL ANSWERS ARE WITHIN THE CONTENTS OF THE MATTER-BEING PARADIGM<br />
</strong></ul>
<p>Answers are provided for the 11 questions posted in The 11 Greatest<br />
Unanswered Questions of Physics, Discover, Feb 2002, by Eric<br />
Haseltine.</p>
<ul> <em>The 11 questions are: What is dark matter? What is dark<br />
energy? How were the heavy elements from iron to uranium made? Do<br />
neutrinos have mass? Where do ultrahigh-energy particles come from?<br />
Is a new theory of light and matter needed to explain what happens at<br />
very high energies and temperatures? Are there new states of matter at<br />
ultrahigh temperatures and densities? Are protons unstable? What is<br />
gravity? Are there additional dimensions? How did the universe begin?</em></ul>
<p><strong><br />
(1) What is dark matter?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>Dark Matter &#8212;&gt; Spirit aspect of Matter defined as Logic-Information and resides in the Logic-Vacuum</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(2) What is dark energy?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>Dark Energy &#8212;&gt;Soul aspect of Matter defined as Information-Energy and resides in the Information-Vacuum</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(3) How did the universe begin?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>The Universe began by a Non-Local Input of the Number-9 into the Logic Vacuum. Embedded in this Number-9 is the Qualitative Meanings defined by Base-9 on all other numbers(see Book and other areas in this Website).</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(4) Are there additional dimensions?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>Yes, these additional dimensions are Logic-Information Dimensions. There are 11 of them as defined in the Posting on What is a Number.</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(5) What is gravity?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">Gravity is Love. That is the Logic of Gravity is Love. (See Book for details, and the Posting, <strong><em>QA: What is Graviton&#8212;-Free-Will&#8212;-Photon</em></strong>)</ul>
<p><strong>(6) Is a new theory of light and matter needed to explain what happens at very high energies and temperatures?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>Yes. For example with the Matter-Being Paradigm, light and matter exist at GUT and are in the form of Logic-Information Potentials (or Monopoles). In short, they exist as in the form of Being. In the vacuum computer model, they exist modules inside subroutines. The outputs of these modules become Matters.</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(7) Where do ultrahigh-energy particles come from?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>These ultrahigh-energy particles come from the collapsing of Logic-Information Potential (or the Monopoles) inside the Vacuum. These Logic-Information Potentials are pre-programmed modules inside subroutines, namely from collapsing the number 9 or its series into other number series.</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(8) Are there new states of matter at ultrahigh temperatures and densities? </strong></p>
<ul>Yes, when the Matter-Being Paradigm is fully understood through both own left-right brains. Remember, these new states of matter exist by different properties as defined by the Being&#8217;s Logic Potentials; rather than in the form of ultrahigh temperatures.</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(9) Do neutrinos have mass?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>Yes, neutrinos have mass in the form of Logic Potentials.</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(10) How were the heavy elements from iron to uranium made?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>They are self-created within the isotope clusters for 27 elements. The self-creation follows the Logic-Information and Information-Energy pre-programmed in the computer&#8217;s subroutines at the GUT period or shortly after (at the Self-Creation of the Vacuum Computer).</ul>
<p><strong><br />
(11) Are protons unstable?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>In the Matter-Being Paradigm, all Logic-Potentials (or the logic component of matter, e.g., the logic component of Protons) can be changed by the power of the observer&#8217;s mind. Even the state of the observer&#8217;s mind is not permanent due to the constant changing frame of reference, however small.</ul>
<p>Even the answers to these questions or for that matter the presentation of this Paradigm, are not frozen due to the fact that the Author&#8217;s frame of reference, as a Quantum Observer, changes (however small) through time. (See the Posting on Frame of Reference for details)</p>
