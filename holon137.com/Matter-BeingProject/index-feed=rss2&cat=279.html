				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>These next four postings are from Volume 1 of 6, <em>Knowing the Unknowable: Glossary/Technical Notes for the Holon Theory of Everything, </em>2004 (See the posting <em>Wing Pon&#8217;s Writings and Videos).</em></strong></p>
<p>We shall now begin a discussion on the meaning of this letter <strong><em>i</em></strong> as it relates to human ascension. This is the <em>i</em><em> </em>embedded in the Biblical phrase <strong><em>i am that i am</em></strong>, or in the phrases as <strong><em>i am</em></strong><em>, </em>and <strong><em>i am that</em></strong>.<em> </em>These phrases tell us the Beings of <strong><em>i</em></strong><em>, </em>or the <em>i</em>ndividual within the different stages of body-soul-spirit development. The phrase <strong><em>i</em><em> am</em></strong> symbolizes an ordinary human Being, in the stage of growing up, from birth up to age 30. This is the stage of body-brain development. This is the stage of preparing, experiencing, questioning, and learning how to be a human Being. For most of you this is the phase of training to become an 8-5 scientist, an 8-5 bookkeeper, or an 8-5 practitioner, or a worker in whatever field of endeavor. For most of you, your learning during this stage of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am</em></strong><em>,</em> defines who you will be for the rest of your life: a scientist, a bookkeeper, an engineer, a doctor, a service worker, and so on. Thus, for most of you, you will be called that engineer, that doctor, that service worker, and so on. In short you will also say of yourself, <strong><em>i am that</em></strong><em>,</em> in the community of humans. For most of you, you are content, if not happy to be &#8220;<strong><em>that</em></strong>&#8220;, all of your life. &#8220;<strong><em>That</em></strong>&#8221; now becomes one’s profession. These are the citizens of the planet Earth. Yet, there are others who never complete this stage of growing up, of becoming “<strong><em>that</em></strong>”<em> </em>Earth citizen. These are the misfits who are overcome by temptation. The purpose of their life is simply to exist.</p>
<p>I have just described the majority (perhaps 85%) of Earth&#8217;s citizens, who grow up to be &#8220;<strong><em>that</em></strong>&#8220;, and are satisfied with being &#8220;<strong><em>that</em></strong>&#8220;, whatever<em> </em>profession he or she settles into. However, there are those professionals, a very small minority, that are not, nay, cannot, be satisfied or happy with their lives or their profession, and not because of money, status, or interests. In fact, these people don’t know why they are not happy. Some of them drive two or three Mercedes, and manage multi-billion dollar international corporations. Some of them become status symbols, the icons, the movie stars of society. Yet they are not happy with who they are, or what they represent. In short, these people cannot use their profession to classify themselves, as I<em> am that</em>, for they don&#8217;t know, what “<strong><em>that</em></strong>” is. This small segment of society is searching for their place in the Cosmos. Each of them is searching for how to become “<strong><em>that</em></strong>” cosmic citizen. So he or she can ultimately classify himself or herself as, <em><strong>i am that</strong>,</em><em> </em><strong><em>i am</em></strong>. Each of them is searching for the real meaning of life. Why was he or she born? What is his or her destiny? In short, each one of them is searching for his or her life path. It was the search for this life-path that drove me, Wing Pon, into constructing this vehicle called Logic-Information, the vehicle that takes you to the non-local world and back. In the process of building this vehicle, I experienced my own body-soul-spirit evolution-involution begin. Starting with the stage of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am</em></strong>, I progressed to the learned stage of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that</em></strong>; and then another stage of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that</em></strong><em>, </em>and finally, to the ultimate stage of finding “<strong><em>that</em></strong>”,<em> </em>in <strong><em>i </em><em>am that i am</em></strong> . This final state in the finding of “<em>that</em>”<em> </em>corresponds to my finding my own Image of God, in the science and technology of Creation/Co-Creation.</p>

<p>Now, with this introduction to the meaning of <strong><em>i</em></strong><em> </em>with respect to self-development, I will discuss the global meaning of <strong><em>i</em></strong>. I shall relate this more personal meaning of <strong><em>i</em></strong>, in the development of your own Being, to the cosmic <strong><em>i</em></strong>, in the development of our universe. I introduce the following diagram, which you will encounter again and again on your trip to the non-local world.</p>
<p>The above diagram represents the nine stages of evolution-involution of our Universe. The contents of this diagram will be part of the subject for discussion at each station along your trip. My job here is to give you an introduction to the Cosmic meaning for the Holon of <strong><em>i</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Before entering into this discussion, you should notice the symmetric nature of this entire developmental process, namely, the symmetry between evolution (the Fall) and involution (the Rise) as shown in the above diagram. Notice also that this is the Fall and Rise of our universe, while the Biblical Fall and Rise is hidden inside the involution process on the right side of this diagram. In fact, you will discover during your trip, that there are two Falls on this right side of the diagram, namely the Fall of right, &#8212; and then of left, &#8212; brain maturity. You will be informed that our civilization is currently inside a Fall at the present moment. This Fall is due to our biased state of left-brain maturity without the balance of right-brain understanding. Altogether, these three Falls form a Holon. The Biblical Fall and Rise will be explained at one of the stations during your trip to the non-local world. Notice that these Falls indicate a moving away from the presence of God, or the continuous process of forgetting our origin. On the other hand, each Rise corresponds to moving back towards our origin by slowly remembering, God&#8217;s original Creation of the state <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong><em>. </em>Therefore, the changing states represented by each state of &#8220;<strong><em>that</em></strong>&#8221; is a state where we are either forgetting or remembering God&#8217;s Created state of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong>. The state of &#8220;<strong><em>that</em></strong>&#8221; changes and is viewed as our knowledge of ourselves, and hence our knowledge of God increases. In short, the state of &#8220;<strong><em>that</em></strong>&#8221; is a function defined by the evolutionary state of our soul and the involutionary state of our spirit. In turn, both the states of evolution and involution depend on the state of our cultural logic. With this introduction, we can now continue our discussion of the left side of the above diagram.</p>
<p>The right side, as applied to a human Being, was discussed earlier with connection to our personal development from being in the state of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am</em></strong> a human Being to the learned state <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that</em></strong> human Being, and finally to one&#8217;s ultimate Being as <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong><em>. </em>I shall next discuss this left side of the diagram, namely the Fall. God Created the Logic for His Initial Beings from the First Cause. These Initial Beings are the elementary particles. Each elementary particle exists in a non-local world of logic in its own Godlike state. This Godlike state is defined as: <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong>. That is to say, these elementary particles are in God&#8217;s presence, the non-local universe, and hence they are in a state of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong>. They exist in a base 9 world of numbers. That is, their actions obey the qualitative rules of God&#8217;s base 9 arithmetic. They also exist in a base 10 world of numbers with the quantitative rules of operation co-creating between God&#8217;s First Cause and the universe&#8217;s evolutionary process. The ability to transition between these two worlds is in the inherent nature of each of these elementary particles. This inherit nature is embedded in the <strong><em>i</em></strong>, the mathematical symbol of {-<em><strong>i</strong></em>}<sup>1/2</sup>, within each of them in their complete state, defined as <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong>. This <strong><em>i</em></strong> is its own self-operator of switching between <em>i</em> representing the logic of itself and <strong><em>i</em></strong> representing the logic in this non-local world, which was also Created by God&#8217;s First Cause. This explains why the body of an elementary particle is a point in space-time; and this point is a singularity. In turn, this implies that an elementary particle exists only in its original God state of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong> without the need to pass through the developmental states of <strong><em>i</em> </strong><em><strong>am</strong>, </em>and <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that</em></strong><em>. </em>This <strong><em>i</em></strong> is referred to by the mathematicians as an imaginary number. Relying on the mathematical property of this <strong><em>i</em></strong>, the quantum physicists developed physics by experimentally observing the behavior of these elementary particles. However, what these physicists did not realize was that what they have described was not the Being in which the elementary particle exists, but their states of Becoming &#8220;<strong>that</strong>&#8220;, which depends on the observer and the conditions of the observation. In other words, what the quantum physicists described was the state of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that</em></strong>, where &#8220;<strong><em>that</em></strong>&#8221; is a function of the observer and the conditions of the observation. This explains the probabilistic nature of the quantum world as described by these quantum physicists.</p>
<p>Going down the path of the Fall, the next Being we come to is the material objects, the rocks, the mountains, and so on. Notice that, as will be described to you during your trip, the initial Being of an elementary particle is a living Being. This next Being, the material object, is a non-living Being: This was a fall from a living to a non-living Being. At this stage of the Fall, the memory of God is completely gone. Their individual existence is its own state of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am</em></strong>, as <strong><em>i am</em></strong><em> </em>a rock, <strong><em>i</em> <em>am</em></strong><em> </em>a mountain, and so on. Now we proceed to the third state of Being, namely, the virus. This is a transitional state of Being, between non-living and living. This transitional state will be fully described during your trip. This is, as shown in the diagram, a Being in transition between, <strong><em>i</em> <em>am</em></strong><em> </em>a living Being, and <em>i am not</em><em> </em>a living Being.</p>
<p>Returning to God&#8217;s presence for us human Beings means using the power of the “<strong><em>i</em></strong>“, as a transition or teleportation operator in the statement of <strong><em>i am that i</em> <em>am</em></strong><em>.</em> This <strong><em>i</em></strong> is transformed in human Beings through the act of <em>i</em>ntention. It is through <strong><em>i</em></strong>ntention that each human enters into this non-local world of God. It is through the act of <em>i</em>ntention that we come to know God. It is through the act of <strong><em>i</em></strong>ntention that each of us can <strong><em>i</em></strong>dentify with the statement, <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong>, the name of God and actually to be in the presence of God. Therefore, it is through the act of one’s own <em>i</em>ntention and one&#8217;s own <em>i</em>dentification with one’s spiritual knowingness that one finds the <em>i</em>dentity of “<strong><em>that</em></strong>”<em> </em>with God in the statement of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>I can now explain to you that the act of <em>i</em>ntention is defined by a Holon with three activating components. These three components are brain activities, soul/spirit actions, and dimensional shifts inside the Moment of Now, which is consciousness. The activities of the brain correspond to our mental activities. Soul actions have to do with space-time perceptions of the wave-energy component of matter. In other words, we must &#8220;feel&#8221; and &#8220;see&#8221; those aspects of reality pertaining to our <strong><em>i</em></strong>ntentions that our brain activities have <strong><em>i</em></strong>dentified. Finally, spirit actions correspond to the knowingness of the logic-information component of matter. The three components of the Holon for <em>i</em>dentifying and actualizing “<strong><em>that</em></strong>”<em> </em>in the statement <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that i am</em></strong><em> </em>are <em>i</em>ntellect-<em>i</em>ntuition-<em>i</em>nspiration. In these components, <em>i</em>nspiration corresponds to whole brain awareness, while <em>i</em>ntellect has to do with left-brain reasoning. The visual activity of <strong><em>i</em></strong>ntuition brings in the right-brain archetype/gestalt understanding. In addition, the activating Holon together with the <strong><em>i</em></strong>dentifying Holon represent the observation Holon.</p>
<p>Individual variations within each of these observation Holons generate the non-uniqueness in the information-energy interchanges of quantum waves or fields of interactions, such as the vortex theory, the spiral geometry, superstring theory, twistor theory, torsion field, etc. Each of these observed interchanges represents the state of “<strong><em>that</em></strong>” in the statement of <strong><em>i</em> <em>am that</em></strong>, where “<strong><em>that</em></strong>”<em> </em>represents a vortex, a spiral field, a string, a twistor, or a torsion field depending on the constraints of the observation Holon. We are referring specifically to each individual observer&#8217;s unique perspective of observation. The non-uniqueness of the wave function is the reason for confusion in the observer’s attempt at understanding his or her observations. What is important is not the decoding of logic into information, or the transition of this information into energy, or the conversion of energy into the mass of a three-dimensional object. What is important is for the spirit to be able to enter into a state of absolute knowingness, inside the logic world, of knowing the encoded logic in question, for it is the logic component of matter that is unique and is the unchanging component in the co-creation technology. And the accuracy of this knowing state depends on the particular stages achieved by the observer&#8217;s soul evolution and spirit involution.</p>
<p>I have, in the above discussion, brought out the following mappings amongst the initial Beings of elementary particles and the Beings of the humans, namely, the correspondences between particle-wave-logic and body-soul-spirit.</p>
<ul>
<li> Particle Component  &#8212;&gt; <strong><em>i am</em></strong><em> </em>&lt;&#8212;  the Body Aspect<br />
(Conservation of Energy-Mass)</li>
<li>Wave Component    &#8212;&gt; <strong><em>i am that</em></strong><em> </em>&lt;&#8212;  the Soul Aspect<br />
(Conservation of Information-Energy)</li>
<li>Logic Component   &#8212;&gt; <strong><em>i am that i am</em></strong><em> </em>&lt;&#8212; the Spirit Aspect<br />
(Conservation of Logic-Information)</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the functions of Human Physiology:</p>
<ul>
<li>The I equals to <strong><em>i</em></strong><strong> am</strong>: Conservation of Energy-Mass &lt;&#8212;&#8212;&gt; Chakra 3 and the Hara</li>
<li>The interactions between <em>i</em> and I: <strong><em>i</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>am that</em></strong>:<strong><em> </em></strong>Conservation of Information-Energy &lt;&#8212;&#8212;&gt; Holon of Chakras 6-5-1</li>
<li>The <em>i</em>: <strong><em>i</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>am that i am</em></strong>: Conservation of Logic-Information  &lt;&#8212;&#8212;&gt; Holon of Chakras 7-4-2</li>
</ul>
<p>The above set of mappings illustrate the entanglement of non-local information between the three components of a non-living Being, or matter, and the three components of the zero-point physiology of a living Being. Disentangling these entanglements is the accomplishment of the Holon Theory and the Health Computer. The mental turbulence, or perhaps spiritual enlightenment, in the author’s states of mind during his attempts to disentangle these Holons and in his process of understanding the Health Computer caused the onset of kundalini in his body-soul-spirit physiology. Now with this Health Computer these entanglements can be safely disentangled with the Computer’s body-mind/soul-spirit mathematics.</p>
