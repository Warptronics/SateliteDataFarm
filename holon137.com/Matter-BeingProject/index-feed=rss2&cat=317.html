				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The next two postings are on <em>The Cygnon Mystery-1</em></strong><strong> and its connections to The Millennial Kingdom, <em>Defending the Second Coming: Cygnon Mystery-2</em></strong><strong>. This cosmic event appears in a few experimental reports, in Nature &amp; Fermi LAT.  Andrew Collins, on the other hand, has done a lot of research in regards to the Cygnon Mystery and its importance to humanity. These two postings expand Collins conclusion and give significance to this event in connection to humanity’s future. Andrew Collins&#8217; research is in his book the Cygnus Mystery; and the following Internet paper, The Cosmic Heart.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cosmic Heart:</strong><strong> BY ANDREW COLLINS</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Recently the prestigious journals Nature and Science announced that Cygnus X-3, either a black hole or neutron star located 30,000 light years away in the constellation of Cygnus, the celestial swan, has now been shown to produce pe­riodic bursts of high energy gamma rays, the first confirmed source in the Milky Way galaxy (Tavani et al, Nature, 2009 &amp; Fermi LAT Collaboration et al, Science, 2009. See also Reddy, 2009).</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><a rel="attachment wp-att-7321" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=7321"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7321" title="black_hole_binary_large_1 (1)" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/black_hole_binary_large_1-1.jpg" alt="black_hole_binary_large_1 (1)" width="295" height="299" /></a></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE BLACK HOLE/NEUTRON STAR</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>A new branch of experimental physics has recently emerged which some call &#8220;mineshaft physics&#8221; or even &#8220;troglodyte physics&#8221;. Its key element is the mounting of large (and expensive) physics experiments deep underground so that sensitive detectors can be isolated from the strong cosmic ray bombardment at the earth&#8217;s surface. Typically a few thousand feet of rock serves as a radiation shield providing a low radiation environment for these super-sensitive measurements. Experiments now operating in this &#8220;troglodyte mode&#8221; are probing the stability of the proton, or counting neutrinos from our sun, or searching for super-energetic neutrinos from supernovae.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>These underground experiments indeed seem to be seeing something new and unexpected. Some of their &#8220;background&#8221; seems to be an unknown kind of extremely energetic neutral particle which has been christened the &#8220;cygnon&#8221;.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Cosmic Particles</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>What was so amazing about these incoming cosmic particles from Cygnus X-3 is that they were able to penetrate solid rock for a depth of hundreds of meters before finally colliding with localized atoms to create secondary particles known as muons. No other type of cosmic ray was known to do this, causing scientists to assume, perhaps rightly, that these particles were unique to science and perhaps even exotic in nature (i.e., they contradicted the standard model of physics).</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>So let&#8217;s summarize the properties of this new particle. (1) It has no electric charge (and no magnetic charge); (2) it has a rest mass estimated to be somewhere between zero and about 1/20 of a proton mass; (3) it is a strongly interacting particle; and (4) It must be stable or at least have a half-life greater than a day or so.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The zero charge of the cygnons is intriguing, for all of the known stable neutral particles can be counted on the fingers of one hand with a few fingers left over. The only truly stable neutral particles are photons, neutrinos, and neutral atoms. For good measure we could include the neutron, which is unstable to beta decay with a half life of 10.6 minutes. There are good reasons for eliminating each of these as cygnon candidates. As all good Analog readers know, relativity makes clocks run slower. Neutrons could possibly make it from Cygnus X-3 to Earth before decaying if they traveled so fast that relativistic time dilation slowed their internal clock until 10 minutes of internal neutron time became equivalent to 30,000 years of earth time. But this time dilation factor needs neutrons with 100 times more energy than the most energetic cygnon events …</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>In Matter-Being Physics, Time and Space does not enter into the Cygnons travel equation because it is a Monopole-Dipole, i.e., In-Out Vacuum Event. It is a NOW Event. For example, H- inside the Vacuum collapsed into a H+ Outside the Vacuum, where time and space do not enter. A Monopole—Dipole quantum collapsed event. One may also say, this is a Di-Atomic/Nucleus Event of Hydrogen: H+ + H- &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Photon (</strong><strong>g-</strong><strong>ray or cosmic ray). </strong></p>
<p><strong>To understand this Monopole—Dipole Quantum Collapsing Event, we shall revisit the I-Ching Principle as discussed in previous postings within this Website and summarized below.</strong></p>
