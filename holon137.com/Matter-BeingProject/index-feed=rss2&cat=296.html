</ul>
<p><strong>Remember, the Participatory Universe is a Vacuum Self-Programmable Universe, which is Spaceless and Timeless, thus the Moment of Now contains both the programmed Logic encoded in “earth&#8217;s future” and “earth&#8217;s past”. This logic at the Moment of Now is contained in the Holon Logic of Matter—Being—Ascension as outlined above. This Logic Holon depicts our Logic Vacuum and its execution formed the Information Vacuum. Furthermore, the Spirit World is in the Logic Universe, while the Soul World is formed in the Information Universe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>At Now, Our Physical Universe is a logic state between 5 and 6, which contains the manifested states 1, 2, 3, and 4. All higher logic states (7, 8, and 9) are not yet manifested. The logic of these un-manifested states is embedded in the Involution Logic that guides our Evolution. Yet our free will logic may also manifest in the form of Destructive Logic and Logic Entanglement (see the postings on Nuclear Accelerator Experiments). Remember, see discussion below, State 5 represents stability in physical execution and in non-local information (see discussion below);  it represents intuition so redemption can occur. Redemption leads to the manifestation of number 6 (the human number). Thus, humanity needs to be completely out of State 5 (Brahman Night) and solidly manifested into State 6 (Brahman Day).</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this participatory universe, involution logic [the ascension logic of 7&#8212;8&#8212;9] can b e viewed as logic in &#8220;Earth Future&#8221; created / co-created by God and by Ascended Beings. God is not involved with the state of Us Humans and the Universe as a whole because God&#8217;s creation was completed within the Six Days. Further constructive / destructive co-creation within the Logic-Information Universe would come from us humans&#8217; free wills. The Ascended Beings [our Guardian Angels] would have their own self-survival interests to protect / redeem the &#8220;present&#8221; human race in State 6(-) and will assist us in moving into State 6(+). Perhaps the crop circles are their suggestion to us to combine / integrate both the right-brain ancient philosophy / technology with our left-brain science / technology of today. The UFOs are informing us of what this integrated technology looks like.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>A NUMBER IS ALSO A HOLON THAT CONTAINS BODY&#8212;SOUL&#8212;SPIRIT: BODY&#8212;&gt; MANIFESTED (BODY-BRAIN), SOUL&#8212;&gt; INFORMATION-ENERGY, SPIRIT&#8212;&gt; LOGIC-INFORMATION.<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>9 IN SELF-OBSERVATION &#8212; Written in 1999</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> (Reference Frame &#8212;&gt; Quotations from E. W. Bullinger, <em>Number in Scripture</em>)</strong></p>
<p><strong> I would like to establish the following fact: God created this Universe with numbers 1 to 9. However, what God Created was not pointer reading, numbers in the sense of quantitative units of measurements. What God created and encoded in inner space inside zero are numbers that have unique personalities whose arithmetic follows a unique set of meanings in qualitative communication, namely numbers as archetype logic in the Jungian perspective. The science of God or human consciousness is in the personality of the non-local logic of numbers. All other numbers (higher than 9) are reduced through addition and/or subtraction in Base 9 arithmetic to a number within this set 1 to 9. With this introduction, let us begin the examination of numbers. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Numbers in Soul-Spirit Communication</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>One</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;;"><strong><span> </span><em>… no doubt as to the significance of this primary number. In all languages it is the symbol of unity. As a cardinal number it denotes unity; as an ordinal it denotes primacy. Unity being indivisible, and not made up of other numbers, is therefore independent of all others, and is the source of all others. So with the Deity, the great First Cause is independent of all. All stand in need of Him, and He needs no assistance from any.</em></strong></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><strong> One suggests unity, but at the same time this state of unity is not stable. One represents a closed system and any closed system by its nature is unstable. Thus, a one is a number that is in conflict with its own duality, the environment. Therefore, the number one, the logic body, indicates a lost connection with not only other bodies, but with its own soul. One represents incompleteness in structure, and thus, depicts a Body without the Soul, or a Body without the memory of its Soul. Lost Soul implies a Body without purpose or goals. In addition, because it represents unity and primacy, one can be all egos, for it needs no other. But, One also needs Spirit to define its Soul. In short One needs Two and Three to form the first Holon of Body—Soul—Spirit. </strong></p>
<p><strong> On the other hand, One denotes the return to God for in the beginning, we must begin with God. All our words and works must be characterized by the first words of the Bible: &#8220;<em>In the beginning, God&#8230;&#8221;</em></strong><strong> In summary, One, from a dimensional sense, represents teleportation, from any dimension back to dimension One, in the mirror space inside zero where God encoded His Creation. Thus, a One, in its transcendental nature, is in unity with God, for God and God&#8217;s Environment.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Two</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> We have seen that One excludes all differences, and denotes that which is sovereign. But Two affirms that there is a difference &#8212; there is another; while One affirms that there is not another!</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> This difference may be for good or for evil. A thing may differ from evil, and be good; or it may differ from good and be evil. Hence, the number Two takes a two-fold coloring, according to the context…. The second thing recorded in (the Bible) connection with the Creation was the introduction of a second thing &#8212; Light; and immediately there was a difference and a division, for God DIVIDED the light from the darkness.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> Two is a number representing binary and the logic of duality. It is the fundamental number in the structure of Being: a structure of Body and Soul, or the logic between Body and Soul, or Wave and Particle. Thus, one has no recognition of others or of its own environment. On the other hand, Two, although recognizing that it&#8217;s not alone, is incomplete in its development of communication skills. To be complete the Two, Body and Soul, needs the Spirit, the language of Body and Soul communication. Similarly, Wave and Particle need the rule of Logic in their communications with each other. Therefore, while a One is a Body without a Soul, a Two is the Body and Soul without a Spirit, namely a lost of Self-identity. One needs no relationships with others. Two searches for relationships (partnerships or marriages), but does not know oneself and is without effective communications skills and thus, permanent relationships are hard to secure. In its search for Self-Identity, a Two is blessed with intellect and sensitivity.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Three</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> All things that are especially complete are stamped with this number three.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> God&#8217;s attributes are three: omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> There are three great divisions completing time &#8212; past, present, and future.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Three persons, in grammar, express and include all the relationships of mankind.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Thought, word, and deed, complete the sum of human capabilities.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Three degrees of comparison complete our knowledge of qualities.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> The simplest proposition requires three things to complete it; viz., the subject, the predicate, and the copula.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Three propositions are necessary to complete the simplest form of argument &#8212; the major premises, the minor, and the conclusion.</em></strong></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Three kingdoms embrace our ideas of matter &#8212; mineral, vegetable, and animal.</em></strong></li>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Hence the number three points us to what is real, essential, perfect, substantial, complete, and Divine. Three is the number associated with the Godhead, for there are &#8220;three persons in one God.&#8221; Three times the Seraphim cry, &#8220;Holy, Holy, Holy&#8221; &#8212; one for each of the three persons in the Trinity (Isa. vi. 3).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> As we have in the number one the sovereignty of the one God; and in two the second person, the Son, the great Deliverer; so in &#8220;three&#8221; we have the third person, the Holy Spirit, marking and completing &#8220;the fullness of the Godhead.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Three contains all the components to form a Holon. Three represents the integration of duality. That is, the Three brings in individual differences amongst the duality of the Two. It is the language among Beings through the non-local aspect of each Spirit. Thus, number three offers a logic of yes, no, and maybe for the communication among Body, Soul, and Spirit. Three is the encoded ternary logic in the vacuum. In the transcendental context, Three represents the completion in God&#8217;s creation in the form of encoded logic. That is to say, it is in the Three, the Body-Soul-Spirit, that the connection with God is completed.</strong></p>
<p><strong> The number Three is a Karmic Number. This assignment can be seen from the following passages on</strong><strong><em> The Three-Fold Nature of Temptation</em></strong><strong> and <em>The Three-Fold Corruption of God&#8217;s Word</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The Three-Fold Nature of Temptation (1 John ii, 16)</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;The lust of the flesh.&#8221;</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;The lust of the eyes.&#8221;</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;The pride of life.&#8221;</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>These seen in our first parents when Eve saw (Gen, iii, 6) that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was &#8211;&#8220;Good for food,&#8221;  &#8220;Pleasant to the eyes,&#8221;  &#8220;To be desired to make one wise.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The Three-Fold Corruption of God&#8217;s Word</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>By taking from,</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>adding to, and altering.</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>This led up to the first sin.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>1) </em></strong><strong><em>God had said, &#8220;of every tree in the garden thou may FREELY eat&#8221; (Gen, ii. 16). In repeating this, Eve omitted the word &#8220;freely&#8221; (iii. 2), making God less bountiful than He was.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>2) </em></strong><strong><em>God had said, &#8220;But of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou shall not eat of it&#8221; (Gen. ii. 17) In repeating this Eve added the words, &#8220;NEITHER SHALL YE TOUCH IT&#8221; (iii. 3), making God more severe than He was.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>3) </em></strong><strong><em>God had said, &#8220;Thou shall SURELY die&#8221; (Gen iii 17). In repeating this Eve altered it to &#8220;LEST ye die&#8221; (iii. 3), thus weakening the certainty of the Divine threat into a contingency.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> No wonder that dealing thus with the Word of God she listened to the words of the Devil, and became an easy prey to his guile with which he deceived her.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> No wonder also that &#8220;the second man,&#8221; &#8220;the last Adam,&#8221; when He was tempted by the same tempter, three times repeated the words &#8220;It is written&#8221;! as though to call attention to the occasion of the Fall in the three-fold perversion of God&#8217;s Words. &#8220;It is written,&#8221; and I will not omit anything from it; &#8220;It is written,&#8221; and I will not add anything to it; &#8220;It is written,&#8221; and I will not alter it. It is worthy of note that both the temptations began in precisely the same way, by the Tempter questioning the truth of Jehovah&#8217;s Word.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Karma, in the context of the Holon Theory, is created in the process of space-time connections and reconnections, in the negative sense, during the breaking of symmetry at the instant of now. Negative connections are connected events of sin encoded in the soul. There are also positive connections. These positive connections are connected to the non-local information encoded in one&#8217;s spirit and are referred to as Guardian Angels. In addition, these positive and negative connections create the individualities of each Being.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Furthermore, Three, the number that created the first Holon, represents learned knowledge for understanding the trinity of Body-Soul-Spirit. Integrated within learned knowledge is the required attribute in satisfying an inner state referred to as Sageness Within. Free will and Creativity are the attributes expressed in the State of Sageness Within. But this First Holon does not produce a perfect Being. To become a perfect Being, the components of numbers four, five and six have to be satisfied and successfully completed. This Second Holon is referred to as Kingliness Without, and is composed of the numbers four, five, and six. That is to say, Three owns the knowledge, while Six must walk and talk it.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Finally, Two is blessed with many relationships that are not permanent. Three is blessed with a happy family. While Two misses the effective communication skills, Three is blessed with the skill of self-expression.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Four</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Now the number four is made up of three and one (3 + 1 = 4), and it denotes, therefore, and marks that which follows the revelation of God in the Trinity, namely, His creative words. He is known by the things that are seen. Hence the written revelation commences with the words, &#8220;In-the-beginning God CREATED.&#8221; Creation is therefore the next thing &#8212; the fourth thing, and the number four always has reference to all that is created. It is emphatically the number of creation; of man in his relationship to the world as created; while six is the number of man in his opposition to and independence of God. It is the number of things that have a beginning, of things that are made, of material things, and matter itself. It is the number of material completeness. Hence it is the world number, and especially the &#8220;city&#8221; number.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>While Three completes the connection with God, four completes the development of man. That is to say, while Three represents the completion of God&#8217;s creation of the encoded Logic, Four completes the material creation or co-creation by using God&#8217;s science and God&#8217;s creation technology through the process of evolution. Therefore, Four is a number depicting completion. Three is a 2-dimensional Holon, a triangle representing the trinity of God&#8217;s creation. On the other hand, the number four represents a 3-dimensional Holon, or a tetrahedron representing co-creation. While the 2-dimension Holon brings in the communication amongst Body-Soul-Spirit, and is blessed with knowledge, the 3-dimensional Holon completes the process by creating a Mind, the memory of the Soul. Here, Mind is defined as the communication between the Brain and the Soul. The brain is defined as the mental aspects of the Body that is the attribute of the number Two. Thus, the existence of number Four is because of the number Two, or (2 x 2 = 4). That is to say, while Two is blessed with intellect, the Four is blessed with a Mind for its intellect to function. While Two is blessed with sensitivity between Body and Soul, Four is blessed with sensitivity for collective consciousness, which is the attribute known as Instinct. Furthermore, in Three we have the Holon of Body-Soul-Spirit, but the Four is a Holon of Body-Mind/Soul-Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong> In addition, while Four is a number depicting completion, it also means death. Because death is a state of natural completion, Four has to do with Body-Brain activities only. Only the Body-Brain component experiences death. That is to say, although Four is blessed with Body-Mind/Soul-Spirit communication, the works of Four is toward Soul evolution by completing and correcting the Karma hidden in Three. Therefore, man&#8217;s weakness, helplessness, and vanity are expressed attributes of Four. Discontinuousness (death), limitation, details, and dependability are the imperfections resulting from all Body-Brain activities, namely co-creation. Due to imperfections in the activities of Four, stability in all change is needed. This is the attribute of Five.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Five</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> <em> Five is four plus one (4 + 1 = 5 ). We have had hitherto the three persons of the Godhead, and their manifestation in creation [co-creation]. Now we have a further revelation of a People called out from mankind, redeemed and saved, to walk with God from earth to heaven. Hence, Redemption follows creation. Inasmuch as in consequence of the fall of man creation came under the curse and was &#8220;made subject to vanity,&#8221; therefore man and creation must be redeemed. Thus we have:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Father</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Son</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Spirit</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Creation</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Redemption</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>These are the five great mysteries, and five is therefore the number of GRACE.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> Five is four plus one. While Four works to correct the Karma of Sin (not following God&#8217;s logic) encoded in Body-Soul-Spirit, Five is Redemption. The definition of Sin, based on God&#8217;s logic, is embedded in the logic formulation of free will as developed in a later section of this paper. It is through redemption that co-creation is possible. Redemption, an informational state of being free from negative thoughts, is a prerequisite for God&#8217;s science and God&#8217;s creation technology to function, and hence for co-creation to happen. In other words, Five is a number representing stability in the co-creation process. On the other hand, Redemption is a prerequisite for Soul Stability. Redemption is at the turning point of the V-shaped curve representing the fall and the rise in a human&#8217;s state of involution-evolution. One essential attribute of this turning point is stability. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Hence, Five is a number denoting stability, but this stability is a local state. To control this state of local stability, Five is also the controlling number for communication. Thus, Five is also known as the communicator. However, this communication is local in nature. That is to say, Five is a communicator &#8212; local in nature. Locality implies the space boundary that is connected to the workings in the process of evolution, namely the evolution of man toward the development of a perfect human. The perfect human is the attribute of number Six. Therefore one can also say that the existence of Five is because of the number Six. Thus, Five is also a number depicting stability in the fluxes of change. In a playful sense, Five represents every opportunity to mingle, or the freedom toward change. In the fluxes of change, Five has a strong connection with Nature and is blessed with the sensitivity of intuition. In short, while Two is intellectual in nature, Five is blessed with intuition. While Six is the completion of the Second Holon in becoming a perfect human, Five, two plus three, provides the stability and grace for such a development.</strong></p>
