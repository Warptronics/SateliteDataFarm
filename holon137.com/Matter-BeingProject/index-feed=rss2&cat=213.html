</strong></p>
<p><!-- start content --><strong>Consciousness from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:</strong></p>
<p><em>Consciousness is </em><em>subjective experience or </em><em><a title="Awareness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness">awareness</a> or </em><em>wakefulness or </em><em>the executive control system of the mind.<sup id="cite_ref-Farthing1992Psychology_0-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness#cite_note-Farthing1992Psychology-0"><span> </span></a></sup> It is an umbrella term that may refer to a variety of mental phenomena.<sup id="cite_ref-van_Gulick2004_1-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness#cite_note-van_Gulick2004-1"><span> </span></a></sup> Although humans realize what everyday experiences are, consciousness  refuses to be defined, philosophers note (e.g. John Searle in </em><em>The  Oxford Companion to Philosophy):<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness#cite_note-2"><span> </span></a></sup></em></p>
<div><em>&#8220;Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our  consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and  most mysterious aspect of our lives.&#8221;</em>—<cite>Schneider and <a title="Max Velmans" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Velmans">Velmans</a>,  2007</cite></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Within the Matter-Being Paradigm, Consciousness is a non-local event. That is, it has to do with Non-Local Observer-Observed Actions at the Logic-Information Vacuum and/or the Information-Energy Vacuum. The former has to do with the individual&#8217;s Heart-Spirit Communication, i.e., &#8220;non-local readings&#8221; of the Vacuum Computer Codes. The latter involves the individual&#8217;s Brain-Soul visions, i.e., non-local executing of the Vacuum Computer Code via intentions. These communication and/or actions are at the instance of Now, which is spaceless-timeless. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>All other definitions of Consciousness involve only with communication and/or actions after Now; namely local respones to Consciousness or the collapse of Consciousness. Co-Creation involves the synchronization of all three phases in the unity of a Holon [namely, Heat-Spirit&#8212;Brain-Soul&#8212;Collapse] State of Consciousness. As stated earlier, this is the final evolution of the Vacuum Computer&#8217;s language which is pre-encoded in an involution state as the computer&#8217;s initial-final conditions.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS QUANTUM TUNNELING?<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Quantum tunneling</strong> refers to the phenomena of a particle&#8217;s ability  to penetrate energy barriers within electronic structures. The  scientific terms for this are <strong>Wave-mechanical tunneling</strong>, <strong>Quantum-mechanical  tunneling</strong> and the <strong>Tunnel Effect</strong>. The Tunnel Effect is an <a title="Evanescent wave coupling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescent_wave_coupling">evanescent wave coupling</a> effect  that occurs in the context of <a title="Quantum  mechanics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Particles behave in a manner  calculated with <a title="Schrödinger equation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger&#8217;s wave-equations</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Within the Mind-Being Paradigm, quantum tunneling has to do with the Consciousness of a Quantum, namely the Non-Local Observer-Observed. Here the Observer is the wave function Psi and the Observed is the conjugate wave function Psi*. Thus, Quantum Consciousness is the &#8220;lock-key&#8221; action defined as Psi x Psi*. Again, this action is at the moment of Now as defined for the quantum (see the posting, <em>QA: What is Heisenberg Uncertainty</em>).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remember, as defined earlier, this Quantum can be a photon, a beta particle or an alpha particle, and so on. Further, photon tunneling involves with human brain-soul intention and/or heart-spirit communication of which free will is included. Beta tunneling can be viewed as electron tunneling through space and into the nucleus. Notice, tunneling through space is a different phenomenon than putting holes in space. The former is a natural phenomenon following involution logic, while the latter changes involution logic. Finally, alpha tunneling involve with the natural formation of isotope elements, both odd or even isotopes. Thus, formation of both bosonic-fermionic condensates</strong> <strong>are possible.<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Notice, there are also three phases in un-entangled quantum tunneling. These three phases are</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Creates Key to Match the Lock &#8212;&gt; &#8220;Reading&#8221; Pre-Code Phase<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Key looking/found the Lock &#8212;&gt; &#8220;Execution&#8221; Phase<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lock opened &#8212;&gt; Collapsed Phase<br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
