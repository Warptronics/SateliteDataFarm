				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The next set of postings is on comments based on the Matter-Being Paradigm developed in this Website. This set of comments on scientific-metaphysical subjects, as listed below, should further clarify the non-conventional ways of thinking while developing in this Paradigm for Every Subjects of Knowledge (integrated) from ancient to modern. These comments will be presented one at a time in separate postings.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Again, to obtain the maximum benefit from these discussions, the reader must have an open mind, view everything from a holistic way, and with a set of background knowledge pertaining to each of the scientific and metaphysical subject under discussion. This set of background knowledge can be obtained through the Internet search engineers, like Google.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Examples on Comments to be addressed in the coming postings are:<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Creation &amp; Co-Creation</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Force and Motion<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Sizes and Dimensions<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Time and Time Travels</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Scientific Anomalies</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Formulas of Bio-Quantum Observer Reality</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Human Basal Metabolic Frequencies</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Junk DNA</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Ghosts</strong></li>
<li><strong>On the Limitations of Positive Thinking, and so on</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Past Lives &amp; Reincarnations</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Karma &amp; Destiny</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Learning &amp; Free Will</strong></li>
<li><strong>Etc.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Completing this last set of postings on the Comments completes my  life-long quest to Know the Unknowable, Questions AskedÂ  of more than 54 years ago, from 1954 to 2008.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions on the Science of a Human Being (Completing the Human Science of I-Ching Logic):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How could my uncle, a Chinese doctor, determine a patient&#8217;s illness by just touching his or her pulse?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How could my uncle know a patient&#8217;s pre-destiny toward certain health conditions, at a certain age of ones life, by asking ones birth date?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is the scientific explanation for the healing act of the laying on of hands?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How does one scientifically explain miracle healing?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is Ch&#8217;i? What is the scientific explanation for how Ch&#8217;i works?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is an Acupuncture Point and how does it work scientifically?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a Soul, and if so, is there a scientific explanation for its physiology?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a Spirit, and if so, is there a scientific explanation for its physiology?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is Christ the Son of God and can there be a virginal birth?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Will there be a Second Coming? If so, what is its meaning?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there ascension? If so, what is its meaning?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a place called Heaven? If so, what type of science can explain this place?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a place called Hell? If so, where is it and how can science explain it?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a scientific explanation for psychic-energy &amp; paranormal phenomena?</strong></li>
<li><strong> What is consciousness, and is there any scientific explanation for its existence?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there life after death? If so, how can science explain it?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why do I always have an urge to do something, and know not what this something is?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is the meaning of my life?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can we put health and medicine into a mathematical discipline?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Questions on the Science of Reality (Completing Quantum-Relativistic Physics):</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does God play dice?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does Heisenberg&#8217;s Uncertainty Principle hold for all aspects of reality?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is reality really based on a quantum observer?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How does one resolve the duality between left-brain and right-brain reality?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How does one resolve the duality between the wave component and the particle component of matter?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How does physics explain the dynamics inside the Vacuum? What is free energy?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a scientific explanation for the existence of Radionics or subtle energy?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is all velocity restricted to be less than that of the speed of light speed (3 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec)?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How does physics explain non-local influences?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does scalar or longitudinal electromagnetic/gravity wave exist? If so, what field of physics explains their activities?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can physics explain the origin of the Universe?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is there a Theory of Everything in Physics?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is Gravity?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is Dark Matter?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is Dark Energy?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The answers to these questions are in the integration of I-Ching Logic and Quantum-Relativistic Physics, which form the contents of this Website. In the Matter-Being Paradigm, this integration is referred to as the science and technology of a Bio-Quantum. In short, I-Ching Logic forms the Logic-Information inside the Logic Vacuum, while Quantum-Relativistic Physics describes the Information-Energy Paths inside the Information Vacuum.<br />
