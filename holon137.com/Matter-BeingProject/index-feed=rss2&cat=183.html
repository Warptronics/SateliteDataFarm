</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> The structure</strong> of a Matter-Being reference frame has to do with the various observer-observed interacting / communicating dimensions. In addition, these interactions are self-coded in the vacuum computer. To describe the observer-observed interactions, all these dimensions are involved in one form or another. In short, a reference frame is defined inside the Holon dimensions of <strong>Being&#8212;-Computer Code&#8212;-Matter<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> REFERENCE FRAME DIMENSIONS</strong></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3224" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=3224"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3224" title="tem-2 1" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/tem-2-1.jpeg" alt="tem-2 1" width="437" height="433" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The 8-D system</strong> follows the <strong>I-Ching logic</strong> for designing the self-programming vacuum computer. Remember, today’s computer was invented with the binary logic of yin or yang, symbolized as 0 or 1. Notice, as shown in the diagram, there are <strong>three reference frames integrated together in a Holon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The physical side of the Energy-Mass Reference Frame is the definition given by today&#8217;s Physicists, as quoted below</strong></p>
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference</p>
<p><em>An observational frame of reference, often referred to as a physical frame of reference, a frame of reference, or simply a frame, is a physical concept related to an observer and the observer&#8217;s state of motion. … There are two types of observational reference frame: inertial and non-inertial.</em></p>
<p><em>In special relativity these frames are related by Lorentz transformations. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that Newton’s first law holds true …</em></p>
<p><em>Measurement apparatus</em></p>
<p><em>A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the measurement apparatus (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame … This question … is of particular interest in quantum mechanics, where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion.</em></p>
<p><em>In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers&#8217; measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect metrology that is connected to the nature of the vacuum, and uses atomic clocks that … must be corrected for gravitational time dilation. </em></p>
<p><strong>The above Physicists answer is too restricted.</strong> It covers only the frame of reference for Matter without taking into consideration that the observation is made by mind-soul-spirit of the observer including meter readings, whether the observer is a living or a non-living system. This explain the</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> INCOMPLETENESS IN LORENTZ&#8217;S FORMULATION</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the above diagram, even in the Energy-Mass Reference Frame, the physicist&#8217;s answer contains at most half of the Matter-Being interacting dimensions, namely at most half of the input-output dimensions. Let along the most important aspects of the Observer-Observed dimensions are in <strong>the Logic-Information-Energy Reference Frame and the Computer Coding Reference Frame</strong></p>
<p>The two additional Reference Frames are brought about by the addition of the Being component. In clarifying this diagram, the Logic-Information-Energy Reference Frame needs to be further expanded upon, while further explanation of the Coding Reference Frame can be found in the other Posts and in the Book. One additional comment for the Coding Reference Frame is on its dimensions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Free Will component connects all three Reference Frames. Thus, there are Six Coding Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>The most important aspect of <strong>the Logic-Information-Energy Reference Frame is the mind state of the observer and perhaps of the observed.</strong> This mind state with its internal interactions is shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Emotion &lt;&#8212;&gt; Want</strong></p>
<p><strong>Want &#8212;&gt; Produce a Strong Positive Free Will, this Free Will is locally connected to Brain-Body Emotions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Knowledge &lt;&#8212;&gt; Believe</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Believe &#8212;&gt; Produce a Biased Free Will, this Free Will is Connected to the Observer&#8217;s Soul</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Knowingness &lt;&#8212;&gt; Faith</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Faith &#8212;&gt; Beyond Free Will, this Faith is Connected to the </strong></p>
<p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Spirit of Love</strong>. A Strong Faith can dissolve the entire non-local free will field and all entanglements. It short, Co-Creation begins with a Strong State of Pure Love, which is a state of information crossover and energy collapse.</p>
<p>Notice, the state of Want&#8212;Believe&#8212;Faith directly influences both the input-output process and its encoding logic. On the other hand, Believe&#8211;Faith&#8211;Love is connected to the concepts of Truth and Reality.</p>
<p><strong>Reality and Truth:</strong> What is true is real. What is real does not mean it is true.  Reality is observer dependent. Truth is observer invariant and is a continuously approaching state.</p>
<p><strong>Reality and Belief: </strong>What one observes is a state of becoming, and depends on one&#8217;s belief. One’s belief may or may not be real. What is real may or may not be one’s belief.</p>
<p><strong>Reality and Faith:</strong> Faith with Knowingness and Love can create reality. Faith without knowingness is blind faith, while faith with knowingness is intellectual faith. Faith with Knowingness and Love is a state of Co-Creation.</p>
<p><strong>Faith in a Field of Free Wills:</strong> The success or failure of one&#8217;s free will in co-creating one’s reality, within a field of competitive free wills, has to do with the strength in collapsing one&#8217;s free will Holon, knowingness—faith—sticktoitiveness. Sticktoitiveness takes the place of Love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LOVE &#8212;&gt; Sticktoitiveness, without conditions and/or attachment, in a state of knowingness</strong></p>
