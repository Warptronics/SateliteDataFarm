				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It has become clear to this quantum observer, particularly within the frame of reference of this universe with a Self-Programmable Vacuum Computer, that we humans have a very important place in determining the universe&#8217;s destiny. This conclusion is based on Matter-Being conservation, as stated in the following Holon conservation conditions.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[INFORMATION&#8212;ENERGY&#8212;MASS]</strong> <strong>&#8212;&gt; Steady State</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This steady state condition is pre-coded into the Vacuum Computer at logic-information symmetry break of the number 9 in Base-9, namely the Logic Big Bang. It is the destiny of the human&#8217;s 9 state components of mind-soul-spirit as shown below.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>UNIVERSE&#8217;S DESTINY &lt;&#8211;9-6-3&#8211;&gt; ACU-POINT PHYSIOLOGY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=3620" rel="attachment wp-att-3620"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3620" title="tem-2 1" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/tem-2-1.jpeg" alt="tem-2 1" width="466" height="296" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Notice, the above diagram goes beyond the Anthropic Principle.</strong></p>
<p><em>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics">physics</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">cosmology</a>, the <strong>anthropic principle</strong> is the collective name for several ways of asserting that the observations of the physical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">Universe</a> must be compatible with the life observed in it. The principle was formulated as a response to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe">series of observations</a> that the laws of nature and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_physical_constant">fundamental physical constants</a> remarkably take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life as observed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a>. The anthropic principle states that this apparent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence">coincidence</a> is actually a necessity because living observers wouldn&#8217;t be able to exist, and hence, observe the universe, were these laws and constants not constituted in this way. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle#cite_note-12">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The mappings of 3 [the light constant + gnomonic expansion-contraction] in the derivations of all physical constants are formulated in the Book. In short, the collapse of 3 in the Information-Energy Vacuum onto Energy-Mass is a constraint action [pre-coded in the Vacuum Computer] that binds Matter with Being, and co-created a physical universe consistent with life on Earth.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> This intellectual collapse of 3 takes care of the energy-mass term in the Matter-Being conservation equation. What follows is the Acu-Point Physiological explanation for the [local / non-local] Information term embedded in the conservation equation.<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Here, Steady State implies that the state of entropy has a steady state value of zero. That is, it is a steady state between involution and evolution, as shown by the bottom three connecting lines between the 3 logic components [of the 72 to 108 octaves] and the 3 information components [of the 01 to 36 octaves] in mind-soul-spirit. That is, from the similarities between quantum physics (namely the universe number 9) and acu-point number 6 in physiology (see Home Page), and within the point of reference in human&#8217;s steady state Acu-Point circuits, we have the following.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6-HUMAN BECOMES THE IMAGE OF 9-CREATOR<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>9&#8212;HEART/SPIRIT &lt;&#8212;-STEADY STATE&#8212;-&gt; MIND/SOUL&#8212;6</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PURE LOVE PRE-CODED &lt;&#8212;&#8212;&gt; EVOLVED INTELLECTUAL LOVE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What we have here are the three steady state components [again a Holon] that lead to human ascension. Harmony within this Holon has to do with the final destiny pre-coded into the initial-final conditions of the Vacuum Computer.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The six human-states have to do with the 6-Yin and 6-Yang Acu-Point Organ Meridian Circuits. Also Ren&#8211;Du&#8211;Chong Mai are three Extra Meridian Circuits. In addition, each Chakra is formed by three Acu-Point Circuits [a Holon]. These three Mai Acu-Point circuits form the Brain-Heart connection [spirit-mind operator in the logic vacuum], or love-knowingness connection [soul-mind operator in the information vacuum]. I shall conclude here. For more information refer to the Book and the entire Website.</strong></p>
