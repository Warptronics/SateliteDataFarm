				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Aristotle&#8217;s Theory of Causation presented within the concepts of an open system, where the Material Cause is embedded within the Formal Cause, formed the Causation Holon. From the Matter-Being Paradigm, the Material Cause is embedded within an Observer-Observed State for all Open Systems. This modification of Aristotle&#8217;s Causation Theory is shown in the Holon Diagram Formulated below.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-7395" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=7395"></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-7398" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=7398"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7398" title="tem2 1" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tem2-1.jpeg" alt="tem2 1" width="496" height="897" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_cause">Material cause</a></strong><strong> describes the material out of which      something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the      material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It      does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>The </strong><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_cause">formal cause</a></strong><strong> is its form, i.e. the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing      is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern,      essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes      in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e.,      macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the      whole-part causation. Plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in      the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second      place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal      cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A more      simple example of the formal cause is the blueprint or plan that one has      before making or causing a human made object to exist.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>The </strong><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_cause">efficient cause</a></strong><strong> is &#8220;the primary source&#8221;, or that      from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It      identifies &#8216;what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is      changed&#8217; and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting      as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current      understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this      covers the modern definitions of &#8220;cause&#8221; as either the agent or      agency or particular events or states of affairs. More simply again that      which immediately sets the thing in motion. So take the two dominos this      time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also      to fall over. This is effectively efficient cause.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>The </strong><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_cause">final cause</a></strong><strong> is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done,      including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The      final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to      serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also      covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological      causes as volition, need, motivation or motives, rational, irrational,      ethical, and all that gives purpose to behavior.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember, according to the Matter-Being Paradigm, this is a biological universe whose reality is defined by individual observer-observed communication constrained within the following Reference Frame Holon,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-7408" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=7408"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7408" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tem21.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="315" height="264" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>We can now formulate the Causation Holon for the Universe.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-7409" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=7409"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7409" title="tem2 1" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tem2-11.jpeg" alt="tem2 1" width="469" height="872" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Finally, the Universe&#8217;s Causation Holon is the integrated Holon whose three components are [a&#8212;b&#8212;c], [d&#8212;e&#8212;f] and the Big Bang Holon shown above.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Remaining Holon is the Causation Holon for Human Mind, which is shown in the diagram formula below.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-7420" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=7420"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7420" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/tem23.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="415" height="615" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This completes the Holon Causation formulation as presented with the Matter-Being Paradigm.</strong></p>
