				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Science of Holon was slowly developed in this Website from the beginning and officially stated in my last posting on a Holon Creation-Cosmology and continue with this and the next two postings, On Force &amp; Motion, On Size &amp; Dimension, and Time &amp; Time Travels. The most obvious reason for a Science of Holons existence is because this universe consists of three connected levels of reality; namely the Logic Vacuum, the Information Vacuum, plus the Physical World. In Metaphysical terms, these three levels of reality are: Spirit, Soul, Mind (which include body-brain).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ON FORCE AND MOTION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=5369" rel="attachment wp-att-5369"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5369" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/tem22.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="436" height="585" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On Organismic Philosophy</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Whitehead, The Philosophy of Organism: taken in <em>Science and the Modern World.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The doctrine which I am maintaining is that the whole concept of materialism only applies to very abstract entities, the products of logical discernment. The concrete enduring entities are organisms, so that the plan of the whole influences the very characters of the various subordinate organisms which enter into it. In the case of an animal, the mental states enter into the plan of the total organisms until the ultimate smallest organisms, such as electrons, are reached. Thus an electron within a living body is different from an electron outside it, by reason of the plan of the body. The electron blindly runs either within or without the body; but it runs within the body in accordance with the general plan of the body, and this plan includes the mental state. But the principle of modification is perfectly general throughout nature, and represents no property peculiar to living bodies.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>And elsewhere, he continues with the interpretation on the direction of the future of science:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Science is taking on a new aspect which is neither purely physical, nor purely biological. It is becoming the study of organisms. Biology is the study of the larger organisms: whereas physics is the study of the smaller organisms. There is another difference between the two divisions of science. The organisms of biology include as ingredients and smaller organisms of physics…</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chinese Organismic Science</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Western philosophy of organism has its starting point in Leibniz’s introspective philosophy of Nature.  Leibniz prepared the way for Hegel and his dynamic concept of forms, Marx and Engels’ integrative levels, Lloyd Morgan and Smuts’ concept of emergent evolution, Alexander and Whitehead and their full organismic view of the world, and finally von Bertalanffy’s contemporary philosophy of organism which is known as the General System Theory.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For a detail presentation on the evolution of Organismic Science, see my first book (1978) on <em>Journey into a Science of Reality: An East-West View of Reality.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Force and Motion Based on Organismic Philosophy</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let us start with Bertrand Russell’s example on the abolition of force, taken from his book, <em>The ABC of Relativity, as stated below. </em></strong><strong>The quotation of Russell offers a psychological form of force and motion, although he did not addresses it in the organismic way.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>We can now begin to interpret the common-sense notion of one body having an ‘effect’ upon another, which we must do if we are really to understand what is meant by the abolition of ‘force.’ Suppse you come into a dark room and switch on the electric light: the appearance of everything in the room is changed. Since everything in the room is visible because it reflects the electric light, this case is really analogous to that of the image in the mirror; the electric light is the centre from which all the changes emanate. In this … the more important case is when the effect is a movement. Suppose you let loose a tiger in the middle of a Bank Holiday crowd: they would all move, and the tiger would be the centre of their various movements. A person who could see the people but not the tiger would infer that there was something repulsive at that point. We say in this case that the tiger has an effect upon the people, and we might describe the tiger’s action upon them as of the nature of a repulsive force. We know, however, that they fly because of something which happens to them, not merely because the tiger is where he is. They fly because they can see and hear him, that is to say, because certain waves reach their eyes and ears. If these waves could be made to reach them without there being any tiger, they would fly just as fast, because the neighbourhood would seem to them just as unpleasant.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Observer&#8211;Reference Frame&#8211;Observed analysis on the above example is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observer &#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> A Person</strong></li>
<li><strong>Observed &#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> People flying out of the Bank [interpreted as a repulsive force]. The effect is a change in a “Psychological state”.  The state is a change in information-energy, namely in the mind of an observer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reference Frame&#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> The tiger’s action. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As Compared to Newtonian Force</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>From Newtonian Physics<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observer &#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> a classical particle</strong></li>
<li><strong>Observed &#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> a 2<sup>nd</sup> classical particle moving away or toward the first. The effect is a change in states. The states are in distances</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reference Frame &#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> Space</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On <em>Sacred Geometry</em></span></strong><strong>, Robert Lawlor has this to say:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>In science today we are witnessing a general shift away from the assumption that the fundamental nature of matter can be considered from the point of view of substance (particles, quanta) to the concept that the fundamental nature of the material world is knowable only through its underlying patterns …</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The point of view of modern force-field theory and wave mechanics corresponds to the ancient geometric-harmonic vision of universal order as being an interwoven configuration of wave patterns. Bertrand Russell, who began to see the profound value of the musical and geometric base to what we now call Pythagorean mathematics and number theory, also supported this view in The Analysis of Matter  ‘What we perceive as various qualities of matter,’ he said, ‘are actually differences in periodicity.’</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Observer&#8211;Reference Frame&#8211;Observed analysis on the Logic of Motion defined as gnomonic expansion-contraction, where examples are presented in Sacred Geometry, is outlined below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gnomon Expansion and Contraction: A gnomon is any figure which, when added to an original figure, leaves the resultant figure similar to the origin.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observer &#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> A figure in logic state X</strong></li>
<li><strong>Observed &#8211;&gt;</strong><strong> a 2<sup>nd</sup> figure in logic state Y</strong></li>
<li><strong>Effect: Logic transformation between X and Y. Logic state X is identical to logic state Y in form (in the Platonic sense of the word) before and after the logic transformation, except there is a discrete expansion or contraction of the logic state Y as compared to the logic of the initial state X taken in geometric proportion.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reference Frame: Forms, in the sense of Platonic<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(On the concept of form, see next posting: <em>On Size and Dimensions</em></strong><strong>) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember, Force was defined only in Newtonian Physics. The concept of Force is replaced by the non-local concept of Information-Energy Path in the Information Vacuum, and by the non-local notions of Logic-Information Potential in the Logic Vacuum.<br />
