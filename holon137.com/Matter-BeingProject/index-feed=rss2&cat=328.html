				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Extending the Holon Strong—Graviton—Pure-Love suggested in previous posting to the Holon of Gvaiton—God—Gravitno from the mind—soul—spirit / Logic—Information—Mass Platform, rather than the Physicist’s Standard / Quantum Gravity Model. This extension of the Gravity Quantum Particle Holon can be summarized as follows.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-8540" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=8540"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8540" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tem28.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="399" height="1134" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The above diagram formula completes the Holon Theory of Everything, from elementary particles to chakra physiology and every subjects of knowledge in between, in the platform of God’s Love via the three Holons of 9-component in Mind—Soul—Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The interested reader should research the internet on the Physicist&#8217;s definitions (and difficulties on formulating the concepts) of Graviton, Gravitino, Gravity, and their forces [which does not exist inside the Vacuum].<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since there is no Space, no Time, no Forces, and no Masses inside the Vacuum, the Physicist’s model of elementary particles with its Standard Model and beyond should be reinterpreted within the Matter-Being Paradigm. This preliminary reinterpretation is stated below (Taken, with slight modifications, from Vol 5 of  Wing Pon’s writing).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s begin with the following quotation taken from the internet on The Standard Model, the Unseen effect that Holds everything together, [with my comments in Brackets]. http://particleadventure.org/unseen.html, <em>The Standard Model &#8211; What holds it together? &#8211; The unseen effect: </em></strong><em><strong>You can think about forces as being analogous to the following situation: </strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Two people are standing on an ice pond. One person moves their arm and is pushed backwards; a moment later the other person grabs at an invisible object and is driven backwards. Even though you cannot see a basketball, you can assume that one person threw a basketball to the other person because you see its effect on the people. </strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>It turns out that all interactions which affect matter particles are due to an exchange of force carrier particles, a different type of particle altogether. These particles are like basketballs tossed between matter particles (which are like the basketball players). What we normally think of as &#8220;forces&#8221; are actually the effects of force carrier particles on matter particles. </strong></em><strong>[These interacting particles are Holon particles referred to as free will, namely love—hate—neutral and the matter particles are mind—soul—spirit Observer-Observed individuals]</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>The basketball animation is, of course, a very crude analogy since it can only explain repulsive forces and gives no hint of how exchanging particles can result in attractive forces. </strong></em><strong>[The repulsive exchanges are in an Observer-Observed State of Hate logic, while the attractive exchanges are in a state of love logic.]</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>We see examples of attractive forces in everyday life (such as magnets and gravity), and so we generally take it for granted that an object&#8217;s presence can just affect another object. It is when we approach the deeper question, &#8220;How can two objects affect one another without touching?&#8221; that we propose that the invisible force could be an exchange of force carrier particles. Particle physicists have found that we can explain the force of one particle acting on another to INCREDIBLE precision by the exchange of these force carrier particles. </strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>One important thing to know about force carriers is that a particular force carrier particle can only be absorbed or produced by a matter particle which is affected by that particular force. For instance, electrons and protons have electric charge, so they can produce and absorb the electromagnetic force carrier, the photon. Neutrinos, on the other hand, have no electric charge, so they cannot absorb or produce photons.</strong></em><strong> [Neutrinos are in a neutral free will state that produces the space between individuals, see the love space diagram shown below.]</strong></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>WARNING</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>If you are absorbing or producing a force</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Carrier particle, you’d better be</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Affected by the force carried!</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Violators will be prosecuted for</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Undermining reality.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My Comments on the Warning.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>If you are absorbing or producing a State of Love,</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>You’d better be</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Affected by the Free Will of Love!</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Violators will be prosecuted for</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Undermining God’s Love.</strong></p>
<p><strong>LOVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next, let us examine the definition of Love from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love, the underlines are my additions.<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>In English, the word love</strong><strong> can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">generic pleasure</span> (&#8220;I loved that meal&#8221;) to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intense interpersonal attraction</span> (&#8220;I love my partner&#8221;). &#8220;Love&#8221; can also refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the sexual love</span> … of the emotional closeness of </strong><strong>familial love, or to the platonic love that defines<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> friendship</span>, to the profound</strong><strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">oneness </span>or devotion of religious love. This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, even compared to other emotional states.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>There are five underlined states of love expressed in the above quotation. By mapping these five states in terms of exchanged distances in love, we have the following table between the distances on the free will states of love and the corresponding exchange &#8220;particle&#8221; observed by the Physicists.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-7503" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=7503"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7503" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tem22.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="481" height="487" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>PURE LOVE HOLONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Holon Between Gods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> God—God exchange in Pure Love</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exchange between Observer Universe-Observed Universes with Pure Love</strong></li>
<li><strong>Between Universes (Our—Other) exchange logic state in gravitino</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pure Love Holon inside Our Universe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exchange Being and Matter Logic is time, i.e., Moment of Now</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gravity: exchange logic state is graviton</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strong: exchange logic state is gluons</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The above diagram formulas are the Mappings between the Physicist&#8217;s</strong><strong> [</strong><strong>精</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>氣</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>神</strong><strong>] </strong><strong>modern left-brain reference frame and the</strong><strong> Psychologist </strong><strong>[身</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>心</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>] ancient right-brain reference frame.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We thus established the connection between love and the exchange particles in physics. As of now, we shall end the discussions with these connections between the logic state of love and the logic force particles modified by the Matter-Being Paradigm for completeness.<br />
