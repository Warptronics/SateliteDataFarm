<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-8524" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=8524"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8524" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tem23.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="487" height="971" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>This diagram further explains the following general descriptions of God taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God</strong></p>
<p><strong>[With the Matter-Being Paradigm interpretations added in Brackets]</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>God is the </em></strong><strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a></em></strong><strong><em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God">name</a> given to a singular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being">being</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism">theistic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism">deistic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religions</a> (and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief">belief systems</a>) who is either the sole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity">deity</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheism">monotheism</a>, or a single deity in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism">polytheism</a>. </em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>God is most often conceived of as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural">supernatural</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_deity">creator</a> </em></strong><strong>[Namely, the First Observer, Observing the Emptiness in the Spaceless-Timeless Vacuums] <em>and overseer </em></strong><strong>[via God’s Involution Logic that guides the Evolution Logic] <em>of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">universe</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology">Theologians</a> have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptions_of_God">conceptions of God</a>. The most common among these include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience">omniscience</a> (infinite knowledge</em></strong><strong> [hidden in God’s Reference Frame Holon of Base-9—Base-10—Free-Will]<em>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence">omnipotence</a> (unlimited power</em></strong><strong> [hidden in God’s Free-Will—Involution Logic]<em>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipresence">omnipresence</a> (present everywhere</em></strong><strong> [defined as Spaceless—Timeless]<em>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence">omnibenevolence</a> (perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil">goodness</a> </em></strong><strong>[in Pure Love Super-Symmetry State, presents in the Holon of Graviton—Gravitino—Gravity<em>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_simplicity">divine simplicity</a> </em></strong><strong>[in the Holon of Simplicity—Beauty—Least-Action]<em>, and eternal and necessary existence </em></strong><strong>[in the Collective Consciousness of the Logic and Information Vacuums]<em>.</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>In short, this diagram-formula offers a post-modern (quantum) understanding of the Word God without the biased connotations of a personalized Human God. Remember, (1) it is this Personalization of God that caused all the destruction in humanity. This formula is derived from the perspective of a Free-Will Participatory Universe participating between God and all of His Creations via the Involution-Evolution-Entropic Logic encoded inside the Self-Programmable Vacuum Computer. Remember also, (2) Spirit is defined as the encoded programs within this Vacuum Computer, and Soul is the executions of these program codes with ones Mind-Brain Operator as the driver. While the computer outputs formed the Physical Universe including its free will self-generated entropy. The third item to Remember, in the formation of a Holon, (3) is the expanded conservation law from Mass and Energy to include also the component of Information generated by the free-will Observers executed with their Local / Non-Local Holon Operator of Mind—Soul—Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally, one might further ask the question: What is this First Observer? The answer to this question is: the First Observer is the Holon Graviton—Gravitino—Gravity via its frame of reference in the Highest Level of Mind-Soul-Spirit defined as </strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄</strong><strong>. Graviton &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Information-Energy State, Gravitino &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Logic-Information State, Gravity &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Collapsed Physical State. Therefore, we can now understand the Why in the following: (1) </strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄 <strong>taken from the aspect of Mind-Soul-Spirit is (1) the Ascended Spirit, (2) the image of God, and (3) </strong></strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄 <strong>taken as Graviton&#8211;Gravitino&#8211;Gravity is the Second coming embedded in the Technology of Pure Love</strong></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOD VS. SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.time.com/time/letters/email_letter.html">DAN CRAY/LOS ANGELES</a>, Sunday, Nov. 05, 2006, Time Magazine<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>There are two great debates under the broad heading of Science vs. God.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The First Debates</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The more familiar over the past few years is the narrower of the two: Can Darwinian evolution withstand the criticisms of Christians who believe that it contradicts the creation account in the Book of Genesis? In recent years, creationism took on new currency as the spiritual progenitor of &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; (I.D.), a scientifically worded attempt to show that blanks in the evolutionary narrative are more meaningful than its very convincing totality.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Matter-Being Paradigm&#8217;s Answer to the First Debates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Intelligent design &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Involution Logic, Knowledge&#8211;Knowingness&#8211;Free-Will, the Frame of Reference of the First Observer<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Live &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Holon of Mind—Soul—Spirit (</strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄, which defines the First Observer)</strong><strong> formulated in this Posting, as shown above. This Formula included the Definition of God as the First Observer shown in the above Diagram. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With the following Mappings<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>神</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>精</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>氣</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>神</strong><strong> &#8212;-&gt;</strong><strong> Spirit in Matter</strong></li>
<li><strong>靈</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in</strong><strong> </strong><strong>身</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>心</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>靈</strong> &#8212;-&gt; <strong>Spirit in Human</strong></li>
<li><strong>靈</strong><strong> in </strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄</strong><strong> &#8212;-&gt;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Mind in the First Observer</strong></li>
<li><strong>魂</strong><strong> &#8212;-&gt;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Soul in the First Observer, Pure Love</strong></li>
<li><strong>魄</strong><strong> &#8212;-&gt;</strong><strong> Body in the First Observer, Humanity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice, the physical variables such as time, space, mass, dimensions are not involve in these mappings.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Second Debates</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>But in fact creationism and I.D. are intimately related to a larger unresolved question, in which the aggressor&#8217;s role is reversed: Can religion stand up to the progress of science? This debate long predates Darwin, but the antireligion position is being promoted with increasing insistence by scientists angered by intelligent design and excited, perhaps intoxicated, by their disciplines&#8217; increasing ability to map, quantify and change the nature of human experience. Brain imaging illustrates&#8211;in color&#8211;the physical seat of the will and the passions, challenging the religious concept of a soul independent of glands and gristle. Brain chemists track imbalances that could account for the ecstatic states of visionary saints or, some suggest, of Jesus. Like Freudianism before it, the field of evolutionary psychology generates theories of altruism and even of religion that do not include God. Something called the multiverse hypothesis in cosmology speculates that ours may be but one in a cascade of universes, suddenly bettering the odds that life could have cropped up here accidentally, without divine intervention. (If the probabilities were 1 in a billion, and you&#8217;ve got 300 billion universes, why not?)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Matter-Being Paradigm&#8217;s Answer to the Second Debates</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Multiverse was proposed to resolve the difficulties encountered in Modern Physics; namely in the incomplete Holon of Elementary Particles—Quantum Physics—Relativities, summarized by Einstein’s Statement “<em>God Does Not Play Dice</em></strong><strong>”. The incompleteness in the Physicist’s understanding lies in their inability to model the zero-point; namely in the concepts of time, space, energy, mass, and finally the definition or the physics of the Vacuum that house the zero-point concept. These difficulties were resolved, at least preliminary, within the Matter-Being Project introduced inside the 142 Postings in this Website.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A GENERAL DEFINITION ON THE TECHNOLOGY OF LOVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the concept of a Participatory Universe, the universe’s entire History and Potential Future are encoded and pre-encoded in the GUT Monopole. In the Matter-Being Paradigm, these Monopoles are the programs—modules—sub-routines inside the Self-Programmable Vacuum Computer. These are the Involution—Evolution—Entropy States. One might concluded that God’s Logic of Love is encoded in these Involutionary States that guided the formation of the universe, which are the Logic-Magnetic monopoles. Thus, the Technology of Love can be viewed as Monopole Vacuum Technology, i.e., methods of extracting and converting the Monopoles into dipoles of Evolutionary-Entropy States. Here Evolutionary states are inventive states. These are invention (either human made or evolved) extracted from the Vacuum Computer. For this to be successful, the entropy states must be understood and shielded. Examples are room temperature free-energy and superconductivity that connect directly to mind-spirit health in moving from </strong><strong>身</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>心</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>靈</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄</strong><strong>. Thus, this Technology of Love can also be referred to as Ascension Technology.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow from the collapse of Monopole in Involution Logic onto the Energy-Mass Dipole of Evolution-Entropy are the Physical outputs in Love-Hate or Attractive-Repulsive Holons. Examples of such Holons are Evolution—Entropy—Electromagnetic, Evolution—Entropy—Personality, and so on. In short, the Love or Attractive component corresponds to Evolution, while the Hate or Repulsive component contributes to Entropy. Furthermore, every one these Holons involve with one or more of the three levels of Mind&#8212;Soul&#8212;Spirit Free Will(s).</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="center"><strong>THE GEOMETRY OF THE COSMIC MIND</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Adding the Hawking Radiation to complete this Spaceless-Timeless Cosmology, we have for both Micro Black Hole and Black Hole the following Holon Diagram</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-8565" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=8565"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8565" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tem25.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="374" height="448" /></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A Remember: the above diagram is connected to the Holon of </strong><strong>Neutral Lines&#8212;Photon&#8212;Light.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice, atomic radiations (different from Hawking radiation) are generated by Free Will Collapsing the Logic-Information component of the elementary particle. This collapse produces the Energy-Masses of various elementary particles, such as the gamma rays. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Negative Affects of Today’s Technology on both Evolution / Involution Logic</strong></p>
<p><strong>I shall conclude this posting with the following reminder on the destructive nature of today’s left-brain technology, e.g.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ON EVOLUTION: HAARP / Tesla-Wave &#8212;-&gt;</strong><strong> Left-brain Radionics, Destructive to the Information Vacuum with negative affects on the Universe’s Path of Evolution</strong></li>
<li><strong>ON INVOLUTION: Nuclear Energy / Large Hadron Collider &#8212;-&gt;</strong><strong> Many micro Big Bangs with possible destruction to the Holon of God (Involution Logic)—Nature—Spirit, which can modify in a negative way the universe’s pre-coded Involution program.</strong></li>
</ul>
