				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><strong>Six</strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Six is either 4 plus 2, i.e., man&#8217;s world (4) with man&#8217;s enmity to God (2) brought in; or it is 5 plus 1, the grace of God made without man&#8217;s addition to it, or perversion, or corruption of it: or it is 7 minus 1, i.e., man&#8217;s coming short of spiritual perfection. In any case, therefore, it has to do with man; it is the number of imperfection; the human number; the number of MAN as destitute of God, without God, without Christ.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> At any rate it is certain that man was created on the sixth day, and thus he has the number six impressed upon him. Moreover, six days were appointed to him for his labor; while one day is associated in sovereignty with the Lord God, at His rest.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Six, therefore, is the number of labor also, of man&#8217;s labor as apart and distinct from God&#8217;s rest. True, it marks the completion of Creation as God&#8217;s work, and therefore the number is significant concerning secular completeness.</em></strong> <strong><em>The serpent also was created on the sixth day.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The serpent also was created on the sixth day</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Sixth Commandment relates to the worst </em></strong><br />
<strong><em> Sin, —murder.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Six is the number stamped on all that is connected with human labor. We see it stamped upon his measures which he uses in his labor, and on the time during which he labors. And we see this from the very beginning.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong> <strong> Six is also a Karmic Number. Six is a number for man to complete his labor to become a perfect human being. A state of perfection that all of his encoded sins have been corrected, so he can walk and talk with learned knowledge encoded in Three, but in a completed and stable state. This is a state known, in the Holon Theory, as Sageness Within and Kingliness Without. Notice that Six denotes a perfect human, but not a complete human. To be a complete human, one needs the completion of the Third Holon with numbers 7, 8, and 9 as its components.  We will see later that Nine depicts not only Sageness Within and Kingliness Without, but also Godliness in Self. This is the Holon of completeness for a human being. Other attributes are expressed in the form of home, marriage, responsibility, and success.</strong> <strong>As can be seen from the above quotation, the Six Days of Creation in the Bible has to do with Creation described in the qualitative meanings of the numbers from one to six, namely from the connection to God in one&#8217;s environment (number1) to the development of a perfect, but not a complete, human (number 6). These Six Days of Creation summarized in the attributes from 1 to 8, including 9, are expressed below. </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>God created the Physical Body whose environment is with God. Therefore, this Physical Body is created as a closed system without a “physical” environment. The Logic Body</strong></li>
<li><strong>God created a Soul as the Body environment. The Body-Soul Duality</strong></li>
<li><strong>God created a Spirit to harmonize the Body-Soul duality, i.e., the Trinity, Body-Soul-Spirit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Completed the process of Creation through co-creating the Mind; thus the beginning of co-creation with the formation of Body-Mind/Soul-Spirit. Completeness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stabilized the process of co-creation for the Body-Mind/Soul-Spirit to evolve into a perfect Human Being. Stabilization has to do with Redemption. Stability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Completed the co-creation of a perfect, but not completed, Human Being. At the same time mankind entered a state of Hell for the serpent was also created on the Sixth Day. Human Perfection is the attribute for Six. A Human Number</strong></li>
<li><strong>Out of or graduation from, Hell for Humans, as he develops his spiritual perfection. Spiritual Perfection is the attribute of Seven. A Spiritual Number</strong></li>
<li><strong>Second State of Completion. For Human, Eight is Resurrection. A Humanity Number</strong></li>
<li><strong>Third State of Completion. In Human, Nine has to do with Spiritual completion blessed with Revelation. God’s Number</strong></li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><strong>Seven</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> <em>We come now to the great number of spiritual perfection. A number which, therefore, occupies a very large place in the works, and especially in the Word of God as being inspired by the Holy Spirit.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>As a number, the actual word and number &#8220;SEVEN&#8221; is used as no other number is used. Seven and its compounds occur in multiples of seven in the Old Testament.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Seven occurs 287 times</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;Seventh,&#8221; the fractional part, occurs 98 times</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;Seven-fold,&#8221; occurs 7 times</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;;"><strong><em>The above three numbers together are of course a multiple of seven, but a very remarkable one, 287 + 98 + 7 = 392, and 392 is 7<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup>, or 8 times the square of seven (7<sup>2</sup> x 8).</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Seven is a number depicting non-locality. Like number Five, which provides stability for number Six, number Seven establishes stability in number Eight. It is different from number Five in its method. Five establishes stability by the Mind of each Being. Seven establishes stability by the Mind of the universe, or the collective consciousness.  In other words, the Mind of the number Five is local, whereas, the mind of the Seven is non-local. In other words, number Five needs messengers to carry the information, whereas number Seven needs no messengers. Again the existence of number Seven is for stabilizing number Eight. With local stability, the Six obtains human perfection. On the other hand, with non-local stability, the Seven obtains spiritual perfection. Here the term &#8220;non-local&#8221; implies soul-spirit communication. Therefore, Seven can also be seen as a number for a psychic connection with God, while Five has the intuitive connection with Nature.</strong> <strong>In a non-local stable environment, Seven completes Soul evolution and is blessed with wisdom. The attributes of a Seven are expressed in learning, patience, faith, and travel, even astral travel.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Eight</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> As seven was so called because the seventh day was the day of completion and rest, so eight, as the eighth day, was over and above this perfect completion, and was indeed the first of a new series, as well as being the eight. Thus it already represents two numbers in one, the first and eight.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Seven means, as we have seen, according to its etymology, that which is spiritually complete or satisfying; while eight denotes that which is superabundant or satiating…</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> … It is 7 plus 1. Hence it is the number specially associated with Resurrection and Regeneration, and the beginning of a new era or order.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> When the whole earth was covered with the flood, it was Noah &#8220;the eighth person&#8221; (2 Pet. Ii. 5) who stepped out on to a new earth to commence a new order of things. &#8220;Eighth souls&#8221; (1 Pet.iii. 20) passed through it with him to the new or regenerated world.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> Resurrection is the great truth which it signified. Christ rose from the dead on &#8220;the first day of the week,&#8221; that was of necessity the eighth day. And it is remarkable that the Bible contains the record of Eigh individual Resurrections (other than the Lord and the saints):</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> 3 in the Old Testament, 3 in the Gospels, 2 in Acts ix. And xx.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eight is a number depicting a society. Eight represents the Being of a Society. It is the source of collective consciousness for number Seven. Because it is created by 2 x 4, it is a complete number in structure (which is represented by the number 2). Combining these two properties, the number Eight is a universal and a complete number. What is missing in the number Eight is the individuality expressed in number One. The individuality in a society is embedded in each one of us that makes up the society, as an individual Being in Humanity.</strong> <strong>The collective development from One to Seven created and co-created a spiritually perfect, but not a complete, Human Being. This represents the completion of the First Stage of Creation and Co-Creation. Eight represents the beginning of the Second Stage of Creation and Co-Creation for a Perfect State of Humanity. This can be seen from the fact that Eight is embedded in the sum of all numbers except the number one: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 44 &#8212;&gt; 4 + 4 = 8. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The two 4s in the above equation mean twice in completeness: the completeness of a Human Being and the completeness of a Society. Furthermore, the absence of number One implies Eight is not yet representing Humanity as a whole. That is to say, Eight depicts a society with a set of collective individual Human Beings. It is the unity of the number One that brings society into a single unit; namely, Humanity as a whole.</strong> <strong>Thus, number Eight exists collectively in the soul and spirit without the emphasis of each body as an individual. Here, addition implies that encoded in the number Eight are the non-local properties of all the numbers within the sum. On the other hand, multiplication has to do with non-local interactions amongst each of the multipliers. The first has to do with the encoded structure in Being, whereas, the second is on the communication among Beings. The numbers in the additional sum are the sources or the contents of information, whereas, the multipliers are the invisible (or spaceless-timeless) messengers, or teleportation operators which make up the flux of information. From this respective, the multipliers are prime and dimensional numbers of teleportation operators.</strong> <strong> Other attributes of Eight are expressed in the form of materialism, power, money, and human compassion. In addition, Eight may possess the higher form of human compassion, namely the emancipation of bodily suffering. This higher form of compassion has to do with the intellectual understanding of the love taught by Christ, namely Intellectual Love from the Crown Chakra rather than animal love from the lower chakras and emotional love from the Heart Chakra. After the emancipation of ones body, the resurrection of one&#8217;s soul begins. Therefore, Eight can also be assigned the attributes for emancipation of the body and resurrection of the soul. What remains is the completeness in one’s development of the spirit by satisfying a state of Godliness in Self. This is completed in number nine.</strong> <strong> The numbers Seven and Eight are humanistic numbers, whereas, the numbers Five and Six are human numbers depicting each individual Being. However, the numbers Five and Six are not complete. Six is a number depicting a perfect human but not a complete human, while Seven is a number depicting a perfect society but not a complete society. For a Society to be complete, we need to go to the qualitative properties of the number Nine, humanity as a whole.</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Nine</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> <em>The number nine is a most remarkable number in many respects. It is held in great reverence by all who study the occult sciences; and in mathematical science it possesses properties and powers which are found in no other number.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> It is the last of the digits, and thus marks the end; and is significant as the conclusion of a matter.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> It is akin to the number six, six being the sum of its factors (3 x 3 = 9, and 3 + 3 = 6) and is thus significant for the end of man, and the summation of all of man&#8217;s work. Nine is therefore the number of finality or judgment, for judgment is committed unto Jesus as &#8220;the Son of man&#8221; (John v. 27; Acts xvii. 31). It marks the completeness, the end and the issue of all things as to man&#8211; the judgment of man and all his words.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> It is a factor of 666, which is 9 times 74.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> The gematria of the word &#8220;Dan,&#8221; which means a judge, is 54: (9&#215;6).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> Nine forms the Third Holon, the last Holon in the system of numbers. The first Holon involves the numbers One, Two and Three. This is the Holon that contains God&#8217;s creation via Logic encoded in the Vacuum. The Logic Holon directs the development of a learned man and satisfies the state of Sageness Within. The components for the Second Holon are numbers Four, Five, and Six. This Second Holon perfects man&#8217;s development in satisfying a combined human state of Sageness Within and Kingliness Without. Therefore, this Second Holon is the Holon of Evolution. Finally, the Third Holon, the Holon of Involution, completes man&#8217;s development in satisfying a Holon State of Sageness Within, Kingliness Without, and Godliness in Self as shown below.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-6379" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=6379"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6379" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tem221.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="308" height="151" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>In addition, Nine brings the attribute of individuality into humanity. Unlike the number Eight, number Nine is embedded in the sum of all numbers including #1:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><strong> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9  =  45 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> 4 + 5 = 9</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here, we have both numbers 4 and 5 in the equation. This can be interpreted as the summation process, namely the formation of the number Nine is complete (number 4) and stable (number 5).</strong> <strong>The completion in ones developed state of Godliness in Self resulted in the Nine becoming a number for spiritual connection, and blessed with the attribute of inspiration. Thus, the following list summarizes the mental attributes for both local (body-brain function) and non-local connections (Mind/Soul-Spirit function), in their corresponding numbers.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Inspiration, Connection with God, The Mirror. <em>Revelation, Ascension </em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 8 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Intellectual Love, Social Connection. Emancipation, <em>Resurrection</em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 7 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Wisdom from Soul Perception, Psychic Connection. <em>Spirit Perfection</em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 6 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Widom from Learned Knowledge, Human Connection. <em>Perfect Human</em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 5 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Intuition, Connection with Nature. <em>Redemption</em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 4 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Instinct, Connection to Collective Consciousness. <em>Co-creation, Mind</em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 3 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Creativity, Karmic Connection. <em>Spirit, God&#8217;s Creation Completed</em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 2 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Intellect, Logic Universe Connection. <em>Soul</em></strong></li>
<li><strong> 1 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Teleportation, Connection with Space Inside Zero. <em>Logic Body</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other attributes that have relationships to the state of Godliness in Self are: Revelation, the Judgment of Man, and Knowledge beyond Learned Knowledge, including Wisdom and Spiritual Compassion. In a higher sense, Nine has the duty of bringing Humanity to the next step and for the individual; Nine is at the final step of Ascension. Finally, as shown in the end of this Prologue, Nine is the magic mirror for this number system. </strong> <strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>THE PERSONALITY OF NUMBERS</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong> <strong> From the discussions presented above on the qualitative meanings of numbers and their Holon Arithmetic, we now conclude that 7, expressed in different ways, as shown below, is not the same.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> 7 = 1 +6, 7 = 3 + 4, 7 = 8 &#8211; 1, 7  &#8211; 2 = 5,  7 = 1 + 3 + 3, 7 = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each of the 6 Sevens, with a different origin expressed in the above equations, has a different personality. Likewise, embedded in each of the 9 numbers, there exists a set of multiple personalities. In short, the personality of a number depends on its origin. Now, the following postulate can be made in connection to these multiple personalities for each of these numbers. The postulate is related to how much memory a number carries.</strong> <strong> For example, compare the following two 8s whose origins are hidden in</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> </strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> 8 &lt;&#8212;</strong><strong> 2 + 6.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong> <strong> </strong> <strong>The origin for the 8 appearing in the first equation &#8220;goes back&#8221; a long way, namely its memory has a long history; whereas, the memory of the second equation could perhaps be referred to as short-term memory. Thus, the postulate in relation to long term and short term memories is this: In evaluating a number&#8217;s personality, for practical reasons, short term memory should be used in understanding its origin. To find the origin of a number with a &#8220;very&#8221; long-term memory (whose origin is expressed in a series), a truncated origin should be used.</strong> <strong> Let us examine the origin of Eight from the equation:</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> 8 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> 1 +2 +4 + 1</strong></p>
<p><strong> The origin of this Eight is</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> 1 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> 4 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> 2 &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> 1 =   8, </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong> <strong>Namely, passing from 1 to 4 to 2 and finally to 1. In this case the personalities embedded in this Eight contain the attributes of the two closest numbers, namely 1 and 2, while all other attributes beyond the 2 is forgotten. That is to say, this postulate restricts the origin of any number to a two-digit number. The purpose of proposing this postulate is to ease human understanding. Practically, it is not possible for us humans to interpret the origin of a number with more than two digits. In actuality, there are differences between a &#8220;Full Eight&#8221; and a &#8220;Truncated Eight&#8221;. Likewise, there are differences between a &#8220;Two Digit Eight,&#8221; for example 4 + 4, and a &#8220;Single Digit Eight&#8221;.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Nine &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Birth &amp; Completion of a Gnomonic Cycle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The entire quotations (One to Nine below) are from Michael S. Schneider, <em>A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Constructing the Universe: The Mathematical Archetypes of Nature, Art, and Science.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> One<em>: The ancient philosophers conceived that the Monad breathes in the void and creates all subsequent numbers (111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321). Numbers only express different qualities of the Monad. The ancients didn&#8217;t consider unity to be a &#8220;number&#8221; but rather a parent of numbers. They noted that unity exists in all things yet remains unapparent. They saw the relation of the Monad to all numbers in a metaphor of simple arithmetic: any number when multiplied by unity remains itself … The same is true when unity divides into any number… Unity always preserves the identity of all it encounters. We might say that &#8220;one&#8221; waits quietly within each form without stirring, motionless, never mingling yet supporting all. The monad is the universe&#8217;s common denominator. The ancient Gnostics called it the &#8220;silence force.&#8221; The universe was carved of this primeval silence. Everything strives in one way or another toward unity.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Two<em>: The paradox of the Dyad is that while it appears to separate from unity, its opposite poles remember their source and attract each other in an attempt to merge and return to that state of unity. The Dyad simultaneously divides and unites, repels and attracts, separates from unity and craves to return to it.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Three<em>: Without realizing it we &#8220;pierce polarity&#8221; whenever we count &#8220;one, two, three.&#8221; Counting is a retelling of the original creation myth in the purest archetypal terms. Primitive tribes often count &#8220;one, two, many.&#8221; The Sumerians counted &#8220;man, woman, many.&#8221; </em></strong><strong>[Three] <em>gives us the ability to transcend polar bounds and realize the unlimited.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong> Four: <em>The birth of the tetrahedron, the first volume, brings the Triad&#8217;s principle of triangular stability to three dimensions using the fewest materials.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Five:<em> …the Fibonacci numbers and the golden mean for insight into the secrets of harmony and beauty, the accord of the parts with the whole. Harmony and beauty are essential part phenomena.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Six<em>: By investigating the arithmetic properties of the number six and the geometric properties of the hexagon, we&#8217;ll find that the Hexad is intimate with both Monad and Triad, the circle and triangle, unity and trinity, wholeness and balanced structure, applying their principles in an advanced way.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Seven:<em> A group of sevens comprises a complete unit, a whole event. But a group of seven is different from other wholes we&#8217;ve encountered, particularly the Monad, Triad, and Hexad. The Heptad expresses a complete event having a beginning, middle, and end through seven stages, which keep repeating. Seven represents a complete yet ongoing process, a periodic rhythm of internal relationships.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Eight:<em> I am One that transforms into Two, I am Two that transforms into Four, I am Four that transforms into Eight. After this I am One again. </em></strong><strong>&#8212; Egyptian (Hermopolitan) creation myth </strong></p>
<p><strong> Nine<em>: Enned seems to be associated with the process of birth. The tail of the sperm half-cell is made of nine twisted threads. After it unites with the egg to form a complete cell, the first visible step in the doubling process of mitosis is the duplication of the centriole. Each centriole becomes a pole and moves to opposite sides of the cell while a spindle of chromosome threads forms between them. Electron microscopic photographs show the structure of each centriole to be a circle of nine parallel tubes.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>[Completeness]:  <em>And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. </em></strong><strong>&#8212;Genesis: 17:1. <em>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, ELL ELL LAMA SABACHTHANI? That is to say, My God, my God; why has Thou forsaken me? </em></strong><strong>&#8212; Mathew 27:46. <em>Facing a wall for nine years. Neither being nor nonbeing stand; the universe is ultimately empty. Nine years facing a wall, who is there that knows? &#8211;Taoist. </em></strong></p>
