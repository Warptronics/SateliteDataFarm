<p>This Website is the result of 55 years of solid research and $4 million spent into finding answers to the unknowable asked by Wing Pon as he travelled through life. Unknowable has to do with Wing Pon’s life-long questions that have no answers from his educational and spiritual upbringing. Unknowable also involves answering those questions our college and graduate school professors, religious and spiritual teachers, and church leaders all tell us that there are no possible answers. They are what they are, so stop asking.</p>
<p>I am happy to say that in my 71 years, I have found answers to all these unknowable questions: (1) from soul-spirit to quantum-relativistic physics, (2) from ancient right-brain technology (referred to Radionics) to left-brain quantum nano-technology, (3) from Creationism to Cosmology, and so on. Furthermore, the fact that all these answers to these very diverse subjects and belief systems are derived from one simple Matter-Being Paradigm is rather unique and somewhat believable.  At least, I have the satisfaction that I achieved the answer to my life&#8217;s work and fulfiled my childhood dream.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>WHY THIS WEBSITE AND WHAT IS ITS PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p align="center">(This Post will be updated from time to time in Responds to Review received)</p>
<p><strong>THE QUESTION ON WHY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To transform this personal paradigm into a Peer Paradigm</li>
<li>To promote left-right brain, scientific-metaphysical, technological-humanitarian Integration via Mind&#8211;Soul&#8211;Spirit health</li>
<li>To promote the science-technology of love and a humanistic path toward ascension</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE QUESTION ON PURPOSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for a ghost writer or partner to make this paradigm, readable to the public.</li>
<li>Looking for a partner to put this paradigm into a series on U-Tubes</li>
<li>Looking for a partner to create the Worldwide Net for the WebHealth computer and develop it into the most economical worldwide healthcare system, emphasizing on preventive health</li>
<li> Looking for an organization to sponsor the experimental research into Bio-Quantum Technology</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
