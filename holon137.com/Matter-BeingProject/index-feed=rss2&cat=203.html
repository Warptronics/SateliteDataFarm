WHAT DO ACU-POINTS, PLACEBOS, RADIONICS, ETC, &amp; QUANTA HAVE IN COMMON?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Within this Matter-Being Paradigm, Acupuncture, Placebo, Radionics, etc and the quanta are all functions within the Mind-Operator. Thus, they all obey the quantum observation criterion in one form or another. These Mind-Operators evoke the mind observer-observed effects.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE MIND OPERATORS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acu-Points, Placebo, Radionics, Mandalas, Occult Symbols, etc are Mind-Object Operators, which affect a Brain-Soul Local&#8212;Non-Local Connection in the Information Vacuum. On the other hand, Quantum is an Mind-Math Operator that affects a Brain-Spirit Local&#8212;Non-Local Connection in the Logic Vacuum. Both cases have the Mind as the Observer. In the first case, the Object is the Observed. In the second case, the Math Operator Symbol <em>i</em> embedded in the quantum wave function is the Observed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember the wave-particle is interpreted within this Paradigm: Wave &#8212;-&gt; Information-Energy or the Soul, Particle &#8212;-&gt; Energy-Mass or the Body-Brain. Thus, the probabilistic behavior of the Quantum, as explained in today&#8217;s incomplete Quantum Mechanics, comes from the ever changing aspect of a particle&#8217;s soul; namely the local&#8212;non-local interconnected-entangled interactions in the information vacuum. This incompleteness is due to the missing of the logic-information component in Quantum wave-function formulation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Within this Paradigm, the logic-information model for elementary particles is formulated using the I-Ching line-diagram logic, namely the yin-yang-neutral, bigram, trigram, tetragram, petagram, and the hexagram (see Book for discussions and other Postings on where Yin-Yang  bigrams model, quarks and leptons, neutral line model, photons, neutral lines in bigrams model gravitons, etc.). These logic-information formulations would naturally complete the vacuum computer model. Adding this model into the Physicist Standard Model of Elementary Particles would complete the incompleteness in quantum formulation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANCIENT MATURED BRAIN-SOUL HEALTH-MEDICINE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACU-POINTS &#8212;&gt; Strong right-brain matured formulation of the logic-information potential based on matured intuitive soul-observation. These soul-observations become the bases for Chinese medical theory / practice, which forme the execution phase in Information-Energy. These Logic-Information Potentials are simple but effective (based on Rules, Similarities, I-Ching Mandalas&#8230;) even in today&#8217;s standard.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> This is the reason why to be a good Chinese medical doctor, one needs to be a good intuitive. Integrating these Potential Operators into modern physiology with data fitting techniques combined with communication theory defines the Webhealth program. The Webhealth mathematics took the intuition (namely the Operator&#8212;Patient&#8212;Computer connectivity) out of the picture</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Notice, w</strong>e cannot compare the accuracy, truth, reality, and/or better between the two mind-operator formulations, one ancient right-brain and the other left-brain of today, for they are</strong> <strong>complimentary to each other. We can, however, integrate the two to form a matured left-right brain model. Webhealth is an initial attempt on this integration.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em>The German &#8230; have shown that acupuncture and sham or minimal acupuncture were equally effective in the reduction of chronic pain symptoms. These results have prompted an ongoing discussion as to whether acupuncture exerts its effects through a <strong>placebo response</strong>. Increasing knowledge about the neurobiology of pain and its intrinsic control suggests a combination of acupuncture-specific neurophysiologic effects combined with effects that match those of expectation-induced placebo analysis. </em>Musial F, Tao I, Dobos G. <strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19557440?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=PPMCLayout.PPMCAppController.PPMCArticlePage.PPMCPubmedRA&amp;linkpos=3">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19557440?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=PPMCLayout.PPMCAppController.PPMCArticlePage.PPMCPubmedRA&amp;linkpos=3</a></strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Devoid of metaphysical thinking, acupuncture becomes a rather simple technique that can be useful as a nondrug method of pain control.&#8221; He believes that the traditional Chinese variety is primarily a placebo treatment, but electrical stimulation of about 80 acupuncture points has been proven useful for pain control.&#8221; </em>Ulett GA, Acupuncture update 1984, Southern Medical Journal 78:233–234, 1985. Comment found at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9853722&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus">NCBI &#8211; Traditional and evidence-based acupuncture: history, mechanisms, and present status. Ulett GA, Han J, Han S.</a></p>

<p><strong>PREREQUISITE FOR MIND OPERATORS</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLACEBOS &#8212;-&gt;</strong><strong> YOUR BELIEF. Hardly any logic-information involved. All based on belief. The strength of a placebo is proportional to the strength belief. The placebos form the bases for all Mind Operators. It is one of the prerequisites for all Mind Operators. Maybe prerequisite is not the correct word, but all Mind Operators must begin with having this placebo effect.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em>The phenomenon of an inert substance resulting in a patient&#8217;s medical improvement is called the <strong>placebo effect</strong>. The phenomenon is related to the perception and expectation which the patient has; if the substance is viewed as helpful, it can heal, but if it is viewed as harmful, it can cause negative effects, which is known as the nocebo e</em><em>ffect. Placebo effects are a scientific mystery. </em><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>(C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>MATURED BRAIN-SOUL TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p><strong>RADIONICS &#8212;&gt;Being Over Matter in non-local&#8212;local effects co-created by ancient civilization where their right brains are fully matured. To understand this Radionic Technology, we need to begin with the definitions for the human soul and the human spirit. </strong><strong>The importance of these definitions is that they help co-created the non-local / local subroutines of the vacuum computer. Furthermore, these subroutines are non-locally interconnected to all routines within the computer and thus are logically connected to everything.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> The physiology of spirit is defined by the non-local physiology of Acu-Points. This physiology functions in the logic vacuum, which obeys the line diagram logic of the I-Ching and the coding logic of the self-programmable vacuum computer. The local constraints on this set of acu-points form the soul, which resides in the information-energy vacuum and is connected to the local / non-local code execution of the vacuum computer. The neuro endocrine constraints formed the Chakra, while the organ constraints are formed in the acupuncture meridian networks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In short, the acu-points with their I-Ching coding logic can be use as the logic common denominator for all. Perhaps, this common denominator can be put in terms of the following I-Ching Logic Holon:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Particle Logic&#8212;-Acu-Point Logic&#8212;-DNA Logic</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>See other postings and the Book for details. From this Holon, we can see the local / non-local connections (in logic-information and information-energy) of the human mind-soul and mind-spirit to everything. It is with this power of the mind that ancient technology co-created and was also cause their own destruction.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>RADIONICS &#8212;&gt; Instruments affecting Being-Matter in today&#8217;s matured age in mass-energy experimentation: As explained in the posting <em>Prophecies-Predictions by a Quantum Observer</em>, we can with today&#8217;s electromagnetic instruments recreate the technology of the ancients, and this re-creation is even more powerful.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em>Radionics devices contradict principles of biology and physics, and no scientifically plausible mechanism of function is posited. In this sense, they can be described as magical in operation. No plausible biophysical basis for the &#8220;putative energy fields&#8221; has been proposed, and neither the fields themselves nor their purported therapeutic effects have been convincingly demonstrated.</em></p>
<p><em>Internally, a radionic device is very simple, and may not even form a functional electrical circuit. The wiring in the analysis device is simply used as a mystical conduit. A radionic device does not use or need electric power, though a power cord may be provided, ostensibly to determine a &#8220;base rate&#8221; on which the device operates to attempt to heal a subject. Typically, little attempt is made to define or describe what, if anything, is flowing along the wires and being measured. Energy in the physical sense, i.e., energy that can be sensed and measured, is viewed as subordinate to intent and &#8220;creative action.&#8221;</em><sup> </sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionics</a></p>

<p><strong>ANCIENT BRAIN-SOUL SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>MANDALAS &#8212;&gt; What are Mandalas? The answer to this question is in the quotations recorded below. These Mandalas represent right brain math formulation, which are as effective as the left-brain Math-Operator in its use as Mind-Operators. They are also form a complimentary relationship with each other.  These mandalas represent the right brain math formula of the ancients as represented in the I-Ching, the Kabbalah, and in all the ancient spiritual philosophies. They are the right-brain scientific formulas of ancient knowledge and visions.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> My experience with Mandalas is in my formation of what I referred to as an Acu-Brain. The Acu-Brain formula comes from the following Acu-Point&#8212;Mandala Holon as shown below.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Essential Acu-Points&#8212;-Mandala&#8212;-Individual Acu-Points</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The individual acu-points are taken from real-time Webhealth evaluations. Essential Acu-Points are the balanced points at the junctions of important acu-point networks.</strong></p>
<p><strong> As I said earlier, it is through the Acu-Brain that I actually experienced the positive mind-soul information-energy affecting myself and my patients.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em>In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of aspirants and adepts, as a spiritual teaching tool, for establishing a sacred space, and as an aid to meditation and trance induction. According to David Fontana, its symbolic nature can help one &#8220;to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises.&#8221; The psychoanalyst Carl Jung saw the mandala as &#8220;a representation of the unconscious self,&#8221;<sup> </sup>and believed his paintings of mandalas enabled him to identify emotional disorders and work towards wholeness in personality.</em></p>
<p><em>In common use, mandala has become a generic term for any plan, chart or geometric pattern </em>[including any Art Forms, e.g., a Chinese character] <em>that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically, a microcosmo of the Universe from the human perspective.</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala</a></p>

<p><strong>MATURED BRAIN-SPIRIT SCIENCE, MATURED IN EXPERIMENTATION (in place of Mind-Soul Execution)<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>QUANTA &#8212;-&gt; Elementary Particles: The following description in accord with to the Mind-Being Paradigm. This word Quantum (of elementary particles) has to do with wave function psi (with the <em>i</em> operator) on the physical side of space (in Base-10 arithmetic) and psi* (with the <em>i </em>operator) inside the information vacuum (in Base-9 arithmetic). Remember, according to the ancients, Creation or Co-creation occurs at the resonance between audible sound and inaudible sound.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Resonance of psi and psi*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>psi x psi* (&#8212;-&gt; <em>i </em>x <em>i</em> = -1)<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Psi and Psi* present the two sides of the quantum or the observer-observed quantum. Resonance implies the collapse of information-energy into energy-mass, from non-local energy onto local energy when stored into the mass and its motions. The above description provides the Mind-Being understanding of this word quantum. What is the nature of these two series (i.e., Base-9 and Base-10)?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em>In physics, a <strong>quantum</strong> (plural: <strong>quanta</strong>) is the minimum unit of any physical entity involved in an interaction. An example of an entity that is quantized is the energy transfer of elementary particles of matter (called fermions) and of photons and other bosons. … A photon, for example, is a single quantum of light, and may thus be referred to as a &#8220;light quantum&#8221;.</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum</a></p>
