<p><strong>Taken from Volume 1 of 6, <em>Knowing the Unknowable: Glossary-Technical Notes for the Holon Theory of Everything, </em>2004<em>, </em>to be used together with those defined in this Website. Without saying, those defined in this Website are more mature. Yet this Glossary is very helpful in the understanding of this Paradigm and in the evolution of the Author&#8217;s thinking. Many terms in this glossary are not used in this Website. These additional terms offer the reader a perspective with respect to the Author&#8217;s thinking, especially how the Author interpreted (intellectually) the metaphysical-psychic world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It took more than nine years to finish these Holon definitions in the glossary and another six years to complete the model on God&#8217;s Vacuum Computer, which defines the Matter-Being Paradigm.<br />
</strong></p>
<h1>A</h1>
<p><strong>Actualization: </strong>(See Free Will)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Alive</strong>: (See Death/Alive)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Anti-Matter: </strong>(See Matter)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Acu-Brain</strong>: As suggested by its name, it is the brain of the acupuncture networks or the network of acu-points. Unlike the physical brain with the gray and white tissues inside the skull of a person, the acu-brain has no physical structure. The structure of an acu-brain is formed by arranging a set of &#8220;key&#8221; acu-points in the hologram, or the &#8220;picture&#8221;, logic of an archetype/gestalt. This hologram, for example the tree of life, is formed in the mind of a person. While the physical brain communicates locally with speeds of 0.5 meter to 100 meters per second via the impulses of a neuron, the acu-brain communicates through non-local influences. Thus, the acu-brain occupies neither space nor time. Its mode of communication is via the conservation between the archetype/gestalt logic and the encoded information of the acu-points. (See Tree of Life, Archetype/Gestalt Logic, and Non-Local Reality)</p>
<p>From pre-birth to approximately 2 years of age, the acu-brain of the logic/information-body governs the “conscious activities” of the child. As the child grows in age, the physical brain of the physical-body slowly takes over, while the acu-brain becomes dormant. One needs to activate the mind/soul-spirit physiology to reawaken the acu-brain. (See Volume 3, Body, and Embryology)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Acu-Point</strong>. An acu-point is an acupuncture point in Chinese medical practices. It is also a node of communication with the spaceless-timeless vacuum, or a zero-point non-local connection via intentions in the physiology of the spirit. The entire system of acu-points, constrained by each point&#8217;s local anatomic-physiology and its acu-brain represents the physiology of a person&#8217;s spirit, which is often referred to as the logic-body. There are, at the present stage of understanding, a total of 850 known acu-points. Each acu-point communicates non-locally between the mind of an individual and the vacuum of an infinite source of information, yet each acu-point is constrained within the local anatomic-physiological information of the physical body-brain activities. Therefore, included in the encoded program of each acu-point is not only the biased physiological disturbances that leads to illnesses, but also the karmic information from previous life-times. In addition, encoded in the logic-body is the potential destiny of the individual subject to the person&#8217;s free-will as he or she completes his or her life-path. (See Volume 3, Karma, Destiny, and Co-Creation/Creation)</p>
<p>In acupuncture, the term “meridians” is used to denote a grouping of 14 common sets of acu-points, based on a similar set of biased disturbances. These 14 common sets of biases form 12 constrained Holons with similar organ-physiological-informational constraints. These 12 Holons, or meridians, are denoted as follows</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Lu &#8211;&gt; Lungs, LI &#8211;&gt; Large Intestine, HC &#8211;&gt; Blood/Circulation/Vascular (Heart Constrictor), Sp &#8211;&gt; Spleen/Pancreas, Lv &#8211;&gt; Liver, St &#8211;&gt; Stomach, GB &#8211;&gt; Gall Bladder, Ki &#8211;&gt; Kidney, Bl &#8211;&gt; Urinary Badder</p>
<p>The remaining two of the fourteen are denoted as Du Mai and Ren Mai, which model the Holon constraints of the yin-yang binary craniosacral circuits. Besides these dual circuits of the craniosacral, there are three other dual circuits. These three correspond to the yin-yang binary circuits of the fascia, which represent the four dimensional webs of elastic, connective tissue that envelops muscles, bones, organs, nerves, blood vessels. These three sets denoted as Yin-Wei and Yang-Wei, Yin-Chiao and Yang-Chiao, and the pair of Mais referred to as Chong and Dai. Integrating the components of these 4 sets of binary meridians form the Holon for zero-point physiology. This Holon integration is also the hidden foundation behind the Shaolin training in muscle-tendon changing and marrow-brain rejuvenation. (See Ch’i-Kung, and Health/Illness)</p>
<p>With respect to health and illness, each acu-point can be in one of five states depending on the status of its biased communication within its body-mind/soul-spirit networks. These five conditions are: a state dominated by an overall yin-condition, a state dominated by an overall yang-condition, a state that needs tonification, a state that needs sedation or a steady state. Thus, the success or failure of an acupuncture treatment depends upon identifying which of the five states each acu-point is associated with the particular disturbance. For example, in the case of tinnitus (subjective symptom of ringing in the ears), the acu-points suggested are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head: GV-20, GB-5, GB-17, GB-18. Around the ear: SI-19, Tw-17</li>
<li>Occiput: Bl-10, GB-12, GB-20.</li>
<li>Neck: Tw-16, St-9, LI-18</li>
<li>Shoulder: GB-21</li>
<li>Back: Bl-15, Bl-18, Bl-20, Bl-23. Abdomen: CV-15, CV-12, St-27</li>
<li>Arms: LI-10, HC-6. Legs: St-36, Sp-6, Lv-3</li>
</ul>
<p>To be successful, an acupuncturist needs to know for each of these acu-points whether to treat the domination of yin or the domination of yang, to sedate or to tonify, or not to treat this particular acu-point because it is already in a steady state. Therefore, although with the identical set of points suggested in an acupuncture book, the treatment will be individually different even with the same symptoms. In addition, these five conditions will change as the treatment progresses.</p>
<p>Perfect health implies all acu-points are in a steady state. It happens that each of these five states can be computed mathematically via an information-communication paradigm. Again the Holon integration of both treatments in the form of sedation versus tonification and yin versus yang is an example of zero-point physiology. (See Zero-Point Physiology, Chakra, and Embryology)</p>
<p><strong>NON HUMAN ACU-POINTS</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Earth Information-Energy Point</strong>: These are Earth’s acu-points. Like human acu-points, they are nodes of communication between the Earth and the spaceless-timeless vacuum. They respond, non-locally and in the space-time continuum to the intention of human spirit and the physiology of soul-perceptions. The information-energy of these points, like those of human acu-points, can be positive or negative relative to human body-mind/soul-spirit physiology. The negative points can be viewed as entropy-energy points, namely points that produce negative reactions in body-mind/soul-spirit physiology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Stonehenge</strong>: A set of Earth’s acu-points arranged in a circle. Similar to the discovery of human acu-points, Stonehenge and similar sacred sites are located on Ley lines on or near the Earth’s acu-points. These sites were discovered by human soul-perception and spirit knowingness at a time when the human’s right-brain was fully matured. That is to say, ancient technology has to do with human extra-sensory capability through a fully matured right-brain without the disturbance of the left-brain. In the Holon Theory, human mental evolution began first with the development of right-brain domination. Today, we have a technology, which is fully dominated with left-brain maturity. And the direction of our future evolution is toward the integration of left and right brain functions with the full development of our anterior commissure. The anterior commissure lies below the corpus callosium. It connects the unconscious limbic structures in both hemispheres and carries emotional information between them. It does not, at our present stage of evolution, connect the conscious areas of the brain, so our own words and thoughts cannot be exchanged.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Ley-lines, Earth Meridians</strong>: Like the acupuncture meridians, these ley-lines are lines formed by connecting multiple Earth’s acu-points.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Geomancy, Feng Shui</strong>: The ancient arts, in a modern setting, of discovering Earth’s acu-points through the technology of human soul-perception and spirit-knowingness. The terms “in a modern setting” correspond to a proto-scientific method, which involves the manipulation of 27 dimensions (or information coordinates) in an apparatus known, in Chinese, as the “geomancy compass”, which is an ordinary compass surrounded by anything from sixteen to thirty-eight rings of symbols for the various Feng Shui. The art of Feng Shui is picking out the harmonies and discordances, relative to human body-mind/soul-spirit physiology, in the landscape. These are the 27 dimensions, with a new quantum-relativistic understanding, used in our embryological mathematics in determining the health of one’s body-mind/soul-spirit physiology. (See Health/Illness, Numbers, Orbifolds, and Embryology).</p>
<p><strong>Ancient Architecture:</strong> (See Body)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Angels/Demons</strong>: In the Holon Theory, Angels/Demons are space-time soul and/or non-local spirit connections between the individual’s acu-points and the cosmic acu-points at the singularity that defines the reincarnation of the individual. The difference between an Angel-connections and a Demon-connection is that the former’s set of connects has to do with information that defines the individual’s encoded destiny, while the latter’s set of connections corresponds to the encoded karmic patterns of the individual. These connections are computed for the individual using the embryological mathematics. (See Acu-Points and Embryology)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Anti-Gravity</strong>: Anti-Gravity is a technology which involves the informed manipulation of the Holon whose components are electromagnetic-gravity-information, within the conservation laws between information and energy in a magnetic dominated medium. Notice, the spiral motion in most proposed anti-gravity designs is in agreement with  a Holon suggestion of using energy from converting space-time information.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Akasha Record</strong>: A record of encoded logic in the Vacuum.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Alchemy</strong>: A proto-science for the refinement of thinking for the sake of the thinker; the search for the elixir of life, or the philosopher’s stone or red powder by which the basic components of matter and the individual’s character are transmuted into one. In the Holon Theory, Alchemy is a method of obtaining spirit knowingness and soul-clarity through correspondence between an individual’s human character and the basic component of physical matter through the knowledge and experimentation of atomic-molecular transmutation, whose activities interact with human intention.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Apriori Knowledge:</strong> Knowledge beyond learned knowledge, or potential knowledge in the form of encoded logic. Knowledge obtained via converting, or decoding, the logic encoded in the vacuum or in the archetypal universe (or the Base 9 World) into information. (See Vacuum, and Archetypal Universe)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Archetype/Gestalt Logic</strong>: An archetype is a set of encoded logic that connects non-locally to the mind/soul-spirit physiology of the inner self. This connection can be actualized via informed intention. The intention&#8217;s functional medium is space-time (or the wave component of matter) with soul connections and/or the vacuum (filled with encoded logic) connecting to spirit knowingness. Gestalt has to do with the holographic, or pictorial, non-local logic expressed in a hologram. Archetype/Gestalt logic denotes the encoded logical connection between a person&#8217;s mind/soul-spirit perception/knowingness and the space-time/non-local informational objects encoded in the holograms. Examples of archetype/gestalt logic in the form of holograms are numbers, Hebrew alphabet, Chinese characters, mandalas, and so on. (See Tree of Life)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Archetypal Universe</strong>: A non-local, or a pre-space and pre-time, universe where the logic (both math-logic and archetype/gestalt logic) component of matter is encoded.  This universe is also referred to as the Base 9 World. This universe is an ether-filled universe. (See Ether, and Apriori Knowledge)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ascension</strong>: Standard religious meaning is: bodily ascent into heaven. In the Holon Theory, ascension is defined as a person satisfying the necessary and sufficient conditions towards becoming a perfect and a complete human Being. The state of a perfect, yet not complete, human Being is defined as the state of Sageness within and Kingliness without. On the other hand, to be a complete and a perfect human Being, a person needs to satisfy the state defined as the Image of God. Image of God is our next ascension to an involutionary state 8 inside an evolutionary stage 9-universe. We are currently in an evolutionary stage 5 Universe heading toward an involutionary state 6, a perfect human Being and an evolutionary state 7. That is to say, within this stage 5 is the involutionary state 6.</p>
<p>Exceptions: advanced spirits ascended into tri-universe 6-7-8 had completed the requirement through the perfection of unconditional love in a state of Godliness in Self, or the state of intellectual love via a state of Sageness Within and Kingliness Without. (See Christ, Godliness in Self, Sagneness Within, Kingliness Without, Parallel Universe, and the Path of Ascension at the end of this Glossary)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Astrology</strong>: Psychological analysis of human characters by means of correspondence between events in human experience and celestial motion. It is usually classified as a method of divination and delineation of character. In the Holon perspective, Astrology is a proto-science on understanding the Ch’i relationship, or the soul space-time and spirit non-local communication, between an individual’s acu-points and the acu-points of the Cosmos. The energy-points, such as the zodiacs, are the Cosmos’ acu-points. These relationships follow the embryological mathematics, which is based on the 27 information dimensions. (See Au-Points, and Embryology)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Astroprojection</strong>: Soul perception, which occurs in a space-time medium where the observation occurs in event-time. (See Space-time, and Event-Time)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Doppelganger, Apparitions of the Living</strong>: An example of uninformed astro-projection. England’s Queen Elizabeth I, pragmatic though she was, saw her doppelganger shortly before she died. The pale and wizened fetch was lying on the queen’s bed. In 1771, the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had a prescient vision of his doppelganger. While traveling to Drusenheim, he imagined seeing himself, in unfamiliar clothes, riding in the opposite direction. Eight years later he found himself on the same road, wearing the very clothes he had imagined. Notice, Doppelganger is a logic-information body.</p>
<p><strong>Aura Energy</strong>: Soul perception in an energy medium where information-energy conversion happens. The aura of a person is also referred to as an energy-body.</p>
<h1>B</h1>
<p><strong>Being/being</strong>: The state of existence. Being, with the capital B, corresponds to a state of existence associated with the state of Sageness within leading to a state of Godliness in self. That is, Being implies that a person&#8217;s state of existence is in a soul-spirit informed state. On the other hand, being (with a small b) represents a simple uninformed state of non-local existence in either animate or inanimate matter. The key in understanding the concept of Being/being is in one’s understanding of the concept of non-local/space-time, or a soul-spirit, state of existence. (See Non-Local Reality)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Biblical Events</strong>: Events of soul-perceptions and/or spirit-knowingness. That is, these events represent the logic-information and/or information-energy aspects of reality. Recorded in these events are descriptions of the manifested right-brain technology of the soul. (See Volume 4, Technology)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Big Bang</strong>: A singularity that occurred at the very beginning of the universe. This singularity was the result of a series of symmetry breaks in the holographic logic of the archetypal/gestalt universe (i.e., the Base 9 World). The first set of symmetry breaks occurred at the Big Bang or zero-time and is between the encoded logic and its embedded informational contents. The second set of symmetry breaks occurred at the interval from Planck time to GUT time (or from 10<sup>-43</sup> second to 10<sup>-35</sup> second) between information and its embedded energy. The third set of symmetry breaks occurred at the electroweak time &#8212; about 10<sup>-10 </sup>second &#8212; between the particle&#8217;s energy and its masses. These symmetry breaks occurred inside the topological universe of observer information. The Big Bang is an event which caused a break from the single logic state of matter into the tri-state of matter in the form of logic-information, wave-energy, and particle-mass that corresponds, respectively, to the first, second, and third sets of symmetry breaks. In addition, the three sets of symmetry breaks generated matter in the form of invisible or potential energy, invisible matter, and visible matter of the 3-dimensional universe; respectively. (See Co-Creation/Creation, and Time)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Black Hole</strong>: A region of space-time from which nothing, not even light, can escape because gravity is so strong. This region represents a singularity in the cosmological scale, yet it has a corresponding connection to the micro scale world of elementary particles. This coupling of the two scales occurs in a non-local dimensional shift inside a state of singularity. This dimensional shift occurs inside a teleportation operator that teleports an object from the black hole into a wormhole and out of the wormhole through a white hole into another region of the universe or into a parallel universe. Notice, this teleportation operator can also be an informed state of intention. (See Teleportation, Singularity, and Wormhole)</p>
<p>Cosmic radio waves are found either in particle accelerators or in black holes. To energize a quasar’s radio-emitting gas in a black hole requires 10<sup>8</sup> x 10<sup>7 </sup>= 10<sup>15</sup> solar masses of chemical fuel (10,000 times more fuel than is contained in our entire Milky Way galaxy). This is the only way possible to convert gravity into energy through implosions, that is, converting space-time information into energy through the Holon of electromagnetic-gravitation-information. Notice that cosmic radio waves are produced by near-light speed electrons that spiral around and around in magnetic fields. The magnetic field forces an electron to spiral instead of in a straight line, and the electron’s spiraling motion produces radio waves. This spiraling motion in a magnetic environment satisfies the criteria for the conversion of space-time information into energy. (See Space-time/Information-Energy Phenomena)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Body</strong>: In the context of a Holon, the following three body components apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spirit &#8211;&gt; Logic Body &#8211;&gt;  Acu-Points/Acu-Brain</li>
<li>Soul &#8211;&gt; Information/Energy Body &#8211;&gt; Chakras/Neuro-Endocrine</li>
<li>Body &#8211;&gt; Physical Body &#8211;&gt;  Anatomic Physiology</li>
<li>Brain &#8211;&gt; Electromagnetic activities of the physical body</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Information-Energy Body, Crop Circles</strong>: Like the Chakras, the patterns of the human soul, these Crop Circles are the patterns of the Earth’s soul. Thus, we have the following correspondences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Acu-Points &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Earth’s Energy Point</li>
<li>Meridians &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Ley-Lines</li>
<li>Chakras Dynamics &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Crop Circles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chakras Dynamics corresponds to the dynamics in collective consciousness and Earth energy. Remember the soul represents the quantum reality of spirit-brain lock-key communication. Like the quantum world, the soul represents a temporary space-time reality of the lock, or the logic of the spirit, finding the key, or the observation logic of the brain. Remember also each of the Chakras is a Holon of three acu-point meridians. This explains that (1) the crop circle designs follow the principles of sacred geometry, and (2) crop circles have been materializing over major ley lines. These two conclusions are included in the summarization recorded in a quotation taken from <em>Atlantis Rising, #14.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> 1. “…crop circle designs flaunting the principles of sacred geometry, either visually or veiled within the construction blueprint, much in the same way ancient esoteric knowledge was hidden within the framework of religious fables or monuments.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “In `Dowsing Crop Circles’ two decades of collective research by noted dowsers Richard Andrews and Hamish Miller, among others, reveals that crop circles have been materializing over major ley lines – the earth’s magnetic energy grid – or their tributaries. Millier had also observed, together with Paul Broadhurst in `The Sun and the Serpent,’ how this energy congregates at stone circles and tumuli.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> 2. “Exhausting lab analysis into hundreds of crop circles… by biophysicist Dr. Levengood reveals physical and biophysical changes in plants inside crop circles. …An effect unique to crop formations and reproduced in a lab setting through `a very rapid rate of heating.’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “This leads to the speculation that the affected plants are ‘microwaved’ for a very intense yet brief period. The groundwater is partly vaporized, partly sucked into the plant, thereby preventing the field from catching fire, while the stems are made supple enough to bend without cracking, enabling them to be easily manipulated into precise patterns.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3. “Colin Andrews notes several accounts of a trilling sound heard by people prior to witnessing crop circles forming. This sound…captured on magnetic tape and analyzed at Jet Propulsion Lab as mechanical in nature…beating at…5.2 k Hz. The same sound had been previously heard by a BBC cameraman while recording an interview…which…rendered two…TV cameras obsolete …Could it be, by implication, that crop circles are the universal language?”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The above properties summarized for the Crop Circles, and those recorded below for the UFO, follow closely the physics suggested by the Holon whose components are electromagnetism, gravitation, and information (See Gravitational-Electromagnetic Field). That is to say, both Crop Circles and UFOs are affected in a magnetic environment. They appear in spiral motions or patterns, exhibit low frequency vibrations, and frequently appear in ley lines. Crop Circles and UFOs are simply information-energy (or electromagnetic-gravitation-information) phenomena. Remember, information is hidden in the magnetic component of the electromagnetic waves of low frequency. (See Technology, and Lock-Key Technology)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Information-Energy Body, UFO: </strong>In John Michell’s research recorded in his book, <em>The New View Over Atlantis</em>, the following finding on UFOs is recorded.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> Seen in their own element UFOs appear as points of concentrated energy. Evidently the phenomenon is connected in some way with magnetism, for several contributors to Flying Saucer Review report UFO activity at scenes of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and magnetic storms. This is a characteristic they share with fireballs and those other mysterious lights, dreaded by lonely travelers at night, known in various districts as devil’s lanterns, will o’ the wisp or corpse candles. Often, as mentioned earlier, these lights regularly appear along certain tracks, following in Welsh legend the rout taken by a bier, for they are seen moving along old church paths, through graveyards, and between spots of ancient sanctity.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> It may be that such phantom lights are manifestations of electromagnetic energy; they are most commonly encountered in the neighbourhood of geological faults (or ley-lines). An article published in the Flying Saucer Review of August 1968 indicates that the same is true of UFOs. The author, M. Lagarde, carried out a statistical analysis of the geographical distribution of UFO activity and found that the greater proportion of sightings took place in areas along fault lines. This discovery is particularly interesting in view of a theory formed some years ago by another Frenchman, M. Aime Michel, who also investigated the pattern of flying saucer reports. In his book, Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery, he gives several instances of straight lines across the earth’s surface, which seem to attract UFO activity, and produces evidence to show that UFOs have a tendency to navigate along these lines, moving over the country by certain definite routes.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> It seems therefore that UFOs are connected in several ways with Druid magic. In the first place, they frequent certain straight lines across the earth’s surface. Secondly, like the lines themselves, they have magnetic associations. Thirdly, the appearance of UFOs is not entirely unrelated to the psychological condition of their observers. This is not, of course, meant as an implication that these apparitions have no physical reality, or that those who see them are mad. But it is a fact that people who see UFOs often experience the sensations of a vision, as if what they are seeing has not only a physical form, but also some further existence as an object already familiar and encountered in dreams.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The comments on Crop Circles, as stated above, also hold for this UFO summary report.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As described in Black Holes, the only possible way for it to exhibit its massive energy is through converting the information, in the vacuum into energy at a singularity. Likewise, the same gravitational phenomenon is happening in Crop Circle and UFO formations, but with much less implosive energy. They are manifested from logic in the collective consciousness, at a singularity through informed intention. Notice, we are at an age of left-brain enlightenment. Furthermore, the collective consciousness could be a combined consciousness, namely a singularity state created through informed-intention where the informed-intention is an intention Holon of past-present-future collective consciousness. (See Space-time/Information-Energy Phenomena)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Information-Energy Structure, Ancient Architecture</strong>: As we have said elsewhere, in the path of human evolution, our right-brain matured first and ancient technology was dominated by their matured right-brain vision in the form of space-time perception and understanding. As explained in the definitions for Space-time/Information-Energy Phenomena, and Technology, controlling the structure of Space-time was perhaps one of the technologies of the ancient civilization. Furthermore, building a right-brain technology without the intellectual understanding of left-brain reasoning was the reason why their civilization was destroyed. What were left behind were the remains of their architectural structures. Thus, it is through the geometry of their designs synthesizing in its architectural proportions that we begin to understand their science and technology. It is through these architectural designs that, in the context of the Holon Theory, we begin to discover that the ancients intuitively understood the conservation of logic and information and the conservation of information and energy. In addition, they understood the power in the information of numbers and its correspondence to the patterns of the universe and of human characters, in a base nine system of arithmetic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In <em>The New View over Atlantis, </em>John Michell has the following observation on the architectural geometry of the Pyramid.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There is no doubt that within the Pyramid’s fabric is encoded many scientific laws and formulae, but the preservation of such knowledge can scarcely have been the only motive of its builders. Its numerical properties must surely have had some practical purpose in relation to the form of science which the Pyramid was designed to serve.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> There has been much talk in recent years of ‘pyramid power’ and the possible function of the Great Pyramid as an accumulator and transformer of cosmic energies. The idea certainly accords with the traditional use of the Pyramid in connection with initiation, magic and mysticism, and it is supported by the occurrence of symbolic numbers in ancient temples to procure the invocation of the gods or aspects of cosmic energy which those numbers symbolized. Pyramid investigators are confronted with an instrument designed for a type of science which today is no longer recognized. It is not, however, beyond recovery, for its records are preserved in the language of numbers, built into the Pyramid’s dimensions, and these provide certain clues to the nature of the Pyramid’s original function</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In summary, the right-brain technology of the ancient civilization understood the conservation of logic into information and of information into energy, while the present technology of the left-brain has an understanding of the conservation between energy and mass. The former involves the understanding of living matter based on soul-spirit observation; whereas the present corresponds to an understanding of non-living matter that follows the mechanistic functioning of physical objects. What is needed in the future is the technological integration of both.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Materialization, Information-Energy/Mass</strong>: The act of converting information into energy-mass. This is the combined technology of both the right-brain, dominated by the technology in ancient civilization, and the left-brain, which is dominated by today’s technology. Thus, materialization, in our opinion, cannot be accomplished within today’s technological understanding. In fact, this is the future technology of Co-Creation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What about reports of seeing a materialized double, for example, the reports of miracles performed by Padre Pio including appearing from nowhere, and helping people in trouble, without ever leaving his monastery near Poggia, Italy. Notice, it is almost impossible to tell a materialized double from that of an information-energy body without careful examination. Thus, in the case of Padre Pio, what people see in their mind’s eye was Padre Pio’s information-energy body. Notice, an information-energy body controlled at a distance from the body-brain networks can perform miracles.</p>
<p><strong>Boson</strong>: An elementary particle whose function is communication. These are whole number spin particles. Examples of bosons are the photons, and the weak gluons, w<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><sup>+</sup></span>, z<sup>0</sup>. The weak gluon z<sup>0</sup> is also referred to as &#8220;invisible light&#8221; or as a heavy photon, while (w<sup>+</sup>+w<sup>-</sup>) and (z<sup>0</sup>+z<sup>0</sup>) are also referred to as heavy gravitons and involves the Higgs interactions in the Co-Creation of mass. On the other hand, fractional spin particles are referred to as fermions and are responsible for building structures. (See Elementary Particle)</p>
<h1>C</h1>
<p><strong>Celestial Stems/Terrestrial Branches</strong>: There are 22 information coordinates that form a logic correspondence to the 22 logic-paths encoded in the Tree of Life. (See Tree of Life)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Terrestrial Branches: </strong> A set of space-coordinates defined qualitatively in twelve information dimensions; and is used in the formulas of I-Ching logic. Each coordinate has its own qualitative meaning in relationship to its communication with the other eleven coordinates and with respect to the particular system in question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Celestial Stems</strong>: A set of time-coordinates defined qualitatively in ten information dimensions; and is used in the formulas of I-Ching logic. Each coordinate has its own qualitative meaning in relationship to its communication with the other nine coordinates and with respects to the particular system in question. This set of 10 stems, by itself as a set, form a logic correspondence to the set of 10 cycles encoded in the Tree of Life. (See I-Ching)<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Chakra</strong>: A hologram in logic-information formed by a Holon of three sets of acu-points. There are seven Chakras for a human being. Taken together, they define the physiology of one’s soul. On the other hand, the logic encoded in all the acu-points, taken as a whole, defines the physiology of one’s spirit. The physiology of the former communicates in a space-time/information-energy medium; whereas the action of the latter, or physiology of the spirit, is communicated through non-local influences.</p>
<p>In an optimum state of body-mind/soul-spirit physiology, each of these seven chakas, except chakas one, six, and seven, are balanced within the Holon fire-air-water. Chakra one is dominated by fire. Chakra six is dominated by air. Chakra seven is dominated by water. Thus, in an optimum state of body-mind/soul-spirit physiology, Chakra-one-six-seven is balanced within the perspective of the Holon fire-air-water. The state of kundalini occurs where air or oxygen causes the state of fire to rise from Chakra one to Chakra six due to an intense activation of Chakra six. The state of kundalini can also occur when Chakra seven is depleted due to intensive spiritual activity. However, for this latter case of kundalini, the direction of disturbance travels downward instead of upward.</p>
<p>Besides the Holon fire-air-water connections from Chakras 1-6-7, there exist also the following two Chakra Holon connections, namely, Chakras 3-4-7, and Chakras 4-5-7. In addition, there are the following coupling communications amongst Chakras 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 4 and 7, and 5 and 6. Knowing these Holon connections and coupling communications is important in determining the overall health status of these Chakras (the physiologies of the soul) with respect to each of their corresponding endocrine physiology, as described below, and in the embryological mathematics.  (See Volume 3, Soul-Spirit Physiology, Health/Illness, and Embryology)</p>
<p>In addition, the communication of these Chakras can also be understood by the concept of source and flow. That is, there are three Source Chakras and three Chakras responsible for the flow of information. The three Source Chakras are Chakras 1 representing the source of fire, 2 representing the source of water, and 4 representing the source of air. The three flow Chakras are Chakras 1 identified with fire communication, 6 identified with air communication, and 7 identified with water communication. Furthermore, Chakra 3 together with the Hara is the source of information coming from the food that we eat and drink. The three components for this Holon are Chakra 3, the Hara, and Food. Treating the entropy produced from Chakra 3 and the Hara is the concept of functional medicine from the Chinese and the germ/fermentation theory of Bechamp, a contemporary of Pasteur. On the other hand, Chakra 5 represents the source of information coming from the air that we breathe. The entropy generated by the interaction between Chakra 5 and the information we breathe into our lungs is the germ/bacteria theory of Pasteur. The three components for this Holon are Chakra 5, Lungs and Breath. The former Holon, related to Chakra 3, developed into today’s functional/energy medicine, whereas the latter Holon, related to Chakra 5, was adopted by conventional allopathic medicine. Lastly, to complete the Holon picture, the third set of sources and flow has to do with the mind-soul-spirit connection to our brain, which represents the encoding organ. The components for this last Holon are soul, spirit, and brain. These three Holons form the embryological mathematics as described in the Holon meaning for embryology.</p>
<p>Next, let us examine the functions of these Chakras, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chakra 7 &#8211;&gt; Knowing, Spirit-Knowingness without attachment or biases</li>
<li>Chakra 6 &#8211;&gt; Knowing, Soul-Perception with bias towards one’s own interests</li>
<li>Chakra 5 &#8211;&gt; Receiving or acceptance of Learned Knowledge, and subject to the constraints of Chakra 7 or Chakra 6</li>
<li>Chakra 4 &#8211;&gt; Communication, constrained by learned and unlearned knowledge. This self-communicated knowledge represents who you are.</li>
<li>Chakra 3 &#8211;&gt; Storage of Emotions</li>
<li>Chakra 2 &#8211;&gt; Survival, by understanding oneself through self-communication with Chakra 4</li>
<li>Chakra 1 &#8211;&gt; Survival, using the learned knowledge from Chakra 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in Holon physiology, the system of Chakras represents the physiological functions, which satisfies the conservation law between information and energy. On the other hand, the physiological functions that correspond to Chakras are the chemistries of the neuro-endocrine system. These chemical activities satisfy the law of mass-energy conservation. The last conservation law between logic and information is satisfied by the non-local communication of acu-points. In summary, the correspondences between Chakras and endocrines are as shown below. (See Glands, and Symmetry)</p>
<p>Chakra 1 &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Adrenal, Chakra 2 &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Gonads, Chakra 3 &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Pancreas, Chakra 4 &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Thymes, Chakra 5 &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Thyroid, Chakra 6 &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Pituitary, Chakra 7 &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Pineal</p>
<p>In addition, the following correspondences, between Tridosa, Neuro-Endocrines, Acu-Point Meridians, for the craniosacral communications can be formulated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air (Flow) &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Pituitary &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Chong Mai</li>
<li>Water (Source) &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Pineal &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Ren Mai</li>
<li>Fire (Sink) &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Adrenal &lt;&#8212;-&gt; Dur Mai</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Channeling</strong>: Knowledge obtained via Soul-spacetime perceptions and/or spirit-nonlocal knowingness. The former corresponds to the use of right-brain intention, i.e., intentional actions within a space-time/information-energy medium; whereas the latter involves the use of left-brain intention, i.e., intentional actions in obtaining knowledge beyond learned knowledge. Knowledge obtained through prophecies, astro-projection, aura-energy interactions, dowsing, and so on are actualized intentions through right-brain soul-perceptions. On the other hand, scientific breakthroughs and knowing the unknowable are actualizations of left-brain spirit-intention. The latter requires learned knowledge, in the formulation of asking/analyzing the specific set of questions/answers, while the former needs very little learned knowledge, e.g., a simple yes/no, a right/wrong answer, and so on. Finally, channeling with the combined actualization of both soul-spirit intentions satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for Co-Creation. These necessary and sufficient conditions are defined as converting encoded logic into information through spirit-knowingness, and the transformation of information into energy via soul-observation. (See Soul Perception, Spirit Knowingness, and Apriori Knowledge)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Charge-Purity-Time, (C-P-T)</strong>: (See Spin)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Christ</strong>: Christ lives in tri-universe 8-9-0 where mass ascensions are heading. On the other hand, an advanced spirit is an ascended individual living in evolutionary stage 7, the next ascended state of us humans. The completed characteristics that define evolutionary stage 7 logic are the states of Sageness within and Kingliness without and Godliness in Self. Notice that state 6 is in both tri-universes of 4-5-6 and 6-7-8. Christ is in tri-universe 8-9-0 in the process of completing either evolutionary state 9 or involutionary state 0. The former is an evolved stage that defines the state referred to as Imagine of God, while the latter corresponds to a God state. Remember, involutionary state 8 is also referred to as Imagine of God, namely the rules for evolutionary stage 9. For the purpose of reference and comparison, we currently live in a tri-universe 4-5-6, a parallel universe to tri-universe of 6-7-8 for ascended Humans. Thus, in his First Coming, Christ descended into our tri-universe 4-5-6 via the parallel universe defined as the involutionary state 6. Remember, evolution is a process with an event duration, whereas, involution is a discrete jump in ascension. (See Volume 4, 888, Ascension, and Parallel Universe)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ch&#8217;i</strong>: Communication or miscommunication between two points. The former corresponds to information transfer; whereas, the latter has to do with entropy transfer. The former involves the generation of usable and free energy from the conservation of informed information into energy, while the latter corresponds to the generation of pervasive energy by miscommunicated information. There are two Chinese characters for Ch&#8217;i. One corresponds to pre-natal or pre-heaven, and the other has to do with post-natal or post-heaven (denoted as Qi, to differentiate from Ch&#8217;i). The former corresponds to non-local influences, communication without a messenger, whereas the latter represents local action with messengers. Here a messenger could be a photon, an electron, an ion, or a virus, and so on. The non-local influences have to do with Li-Ch&#8217;i, where Li means logic, i.e., the logic component of matter. In addition, everything contains Yin-Ch&#8217;i and Yang-Ch&#8217;i. Yin-Ch&#8217;i has to do with its source of information while Yang-Ch&#8217;i denotes the flow information. Thus, Ch&#8217;i, embedded in the total meaning of its two characters, represents the Holon of matter whose three components are logic-information, wave-energy, and particle-mass.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ch&#8217;i-Kung</strong>: Optimum action in the effective use of Ch&#8217;i. Thus, Ch&#8217;i-Kung implies the ability to control, command, and finally co-create matter. In human terms, matter corresponds to the Holon of body-mind/soul-spirit and action implies informed intention. The key in Ch’i-Kung training is the Holon interactions of the following two Holons: the movement/physiology Holon with the three components of Fascia/Acu-Points, Craniosacral/Acu-brain, and Neuro-endocrines/Chakras, and the activation Holon whose components are informed intention, consciousness in a state of singularity, and learned knowledge. To be complete in Ch’i-Kung training, the three disciplines of Yoga, Rolfing, and Craniosacral must be integrated into a Holon of practice. (See Health/Illness, Ch’i, Chakra, Acu-Brain, Soul-Spirit Physiology, and Yi-Gin Ching/Shii-Soei Ching)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Co-Creation/Creation</strong>: Co-Creation is Creation with informed free-will logic via actualized intention or quantum observation. Informed knowledge via perfected intention is obtained from decoding involution logic. Co-Creation also occurs with simple lock-key information of the observer-observed relationship among quantum particles. The former has to do with deterministic Co-Creation, while the latter corresponds to probabilistic Co-Creation. On the other hand, Creation corresponds to the Created logic that has correspondence to the Logic of the First Cause. This set of Created or Co-Created logic is also referred to as involution logic. (See Volume 4, Evolution-Involution, Time, Universe’s Origin, Resonance, and Conservation of Information-Energy-Mass)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Six Days of Creation</strong>: (See Volume 4, Post-Heaven)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Coincidence</strong>: Non-locally connected events. (See Correspondence)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Cold Fusion</strong>: (See Human Atomic Table in Symmetry)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Compactification</strong>: The process of &#8220;curling up&#8221; six of the ten dimensions of superstring theory. (See Curled-up Dimensions)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Consciousness</strong>: Actualized intentions or quantum observations at the moment of Now in a state of singularity. To be at the moment of Now, one must be at a state of soul-perception and/or spirit knowingness; thus consciousness can only be defined within the space-time and/or non-local physiology of soul-spirit. As such, consciousness cannot be defined with the actions of body-brain physiology such as sense perceptions. All actions in body-brain physiology reduce to an actualized state after consciousness had occurred. Therefore, within this Holon Theory, consciousness cannot be created in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Conservation of information-energy-mass</strong>: Unlike the standard law of conservation of energy, which states that energy (or its equivalent in mass) can neither be created nor destroyed, the conservation of information-energy-mass states that energy (or mass) can be Co-Created with the logic-information component of matter. Notice, the term Co-Creation, instead of Creation, was used because all logic-information is derived from or in non-local correspondence with the logic of God&#8217;s First Cause. (See Information)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Wave-particle paradox</strong>: This paradox exists because of the incomplete understanding of the law of energy-mass conservation. In the Holon Theory, the wave aspect of matter involves the conservation of information and energy; whereas the particle aspect has to do with the conservation of energy-mass. Thus, both the wave and the particle contain the same energy component with two different colors; and this also explains the complementary correspondence of the two. In other words, energy corresponding to the wave aspect is colored by its information; whereas the energy of the particle aspect is colored by its mass.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Space-time/Information-Energy Phenomena</strong>: Phenomena manifested through soul-spirit intention. The occurrence of these phenomena follows the conservation of logic-information and information-energy in a magnetic medium. The formation of this phenomenon is enhanced when the electromagnetic-gravity-information Holon is satisfied. Thus, this phenomenon is created within the dimensional shift within an individual’s state of consciousness. Remember that the state of consciousness corresponds to a singularity inside one’s spirit. Therefore, the degree and intensity of the individual’s informed or non-informed intention is also an important issue in the success or failure of creating these phenomena. One can also say that these are right-brain phenomena. Almost all of this phenomenon happens in a trance state, not under the control of one’s free will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Levitation</strong>: Changing the space-time constraints of an object through soul-perception. Remember, soul is defined as the space-time continuum of oneself; thus, the basic structure of space-time and one’s soul are directly connected in levitation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Poltergeist</strong>: Ability to move, generally in a unconscious state, physical objects by one’s mind. The same explanation given for levitation could be used to explain the actions of a poltergeist.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Psychokinesis</strong>: Ability to move, in a controlled manner, physical objects by one’s mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> Stigmata</strong>: Wounds resembling those received by Christ before and during the Crucifixion. These are wounds caused by one’s mind through one’s strong intention and faith in serving Christ, where the devout become too obsessed with the image of the crucified Christ. The explanation is the same as that given for psychokinesis or the actions of a poltergeist, namely, the conversion of information into energy. The difference in this case is that the self-generated energy is used to inflict wounds on one’s own hands, feet, forehead and side.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Constraints</strong>: Constraints are defined as actions that are biased by the uniqueness of the system&#8217;s or the object&#8217;s composition, including its history and its finality.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Correspondence</strong>: Correlative associations in the form of non-local and/or genetic connections. Therefore, unlike the principle of causality, which involves the linear sequence of cause and effect, the principle of correspondence categorizes the non-local connections. (See Entanglement)</p>
<p><strong> </strong>An example of the Correspondence Principle, namely the Five-Element Theory taken from the physiology of Chinese medicine, is illustrated below.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-5892" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=5892"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5892" title="tem2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tem21.jpeg" alt="tem2" width="401" height="237" /></a></p>
<p>Here the individual correspondence, within this five-element spiral, is mapped as follows.</p>
<p>Heart &#8211;&gt; Gums-Tongue/Blood Vessels, Spleen &#8211;&gt; Mouth/Flesh, Lung &#8211;&gt; Nose/Skin, Kidney &#8211;&gt; Ears/Bone, Liver &#8211;&gt; Eyes/Sinus</p>
<p>These mappings carry the following meanings: For example, in the correspondence of abnormal heart functions, the health of the gums or tongue and blood vessels is also abnormal. This does not mean that the health conditions of the gums or tongue and blood vessels were caused by the abnormal heart conditions. There is no cause and effect involved. Perhaps, a better way to explain this is by using the concept of resonance. Likewise, the meanings for each of the remaining four mappings can be interpreted in the same way. (See Health/Illness, and Resonance)</p>
<p><strong>Creation</strong>: (See Co-Creation/Creation, Time)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Creator</strong>: (See God/Creator)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Crop Circles</strong>: (See Information-Energy Body, in Body)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Curled-up Dimension</strong>: A spatial dimension that is curled up so small that it cannot be detected. These curled-up dimensions, in the Holon Theory, represent dimensions of qualitative information; rather than spatial dimensions.</p>
<h1>D</h1>
<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong>: Matter in galaxies and clusters, and possibly between clusters, that cannot be observed directly; but can be detected by its gravitational field. As much as ninety percent of the matter in our universe is dark matter. Here the term matter is defined as wave-particle. In the Holon Theory of matter, i.e., in a Holon of logic-wave-particle, dark matter corresponds to its information-energy component, while visible matter corresponds to the energy-mass component. That is to say, dark matter is potential matter encoded in its information aspect. (See Matter, Dark Energy, and Mass)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dark Energy</strong>: Unobservable energy in the galaxies that is detected from the measurement of the geometry of the universe. In the Holon Theory, dark energy is potential energy converted from its logic-information aspect, namely the conservation of Logic and its information or potential energy.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Death/Alive</strong>: Death corresponds to a state in which the functions of one&#8217;s soul and/or one&#8217;s spirit have been discontinued. Alive implies the existence of a soul and a spirit. (See Soul-Spirit Physiology)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Destiny</strong>: In the Holon Theory, destiny is defined as an action in space-time whose end points, namely the logic of its initial and its final conditions, are defined apriori. With this definition, the destiny of our Universe is defined in God&#8217;s Binary (i.e., initial-final) Input Logic. The destiny of a person is also defined in the involution-evolution Co-Creation logic.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: Converting the logic encoded in numbers into information. If conversion is in base-nine arithmetic, the result corresponds to coordinates in non-local information. On the other hand, if conversion is in base-ten arithmetic, the result has to do with coordinates in geometry. The bridge that connects the two, on the math-logic side, is Clifford Algebra of the various Topologies; and on the archetype-logic (or Li-Logic) side is the pre-motion in the form of gnomonic expansion-contraction of numbers 3 and 9. For fractional dimension, see Fractals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Clifford W. Kingdon,</strong> (1845-1879): Mathematician and philosopher who developed the Theory of Biquaternions (a generalization of Hamilton&#8217;s Theory of Quaternions) and linked them with more general associative algebras. In his philosophy, he presented the idea that matter and energy are simply different types of curvatures of space, thus foreshadowing Albert Einstein&#8217;s General Theory of Relativity. In addition, he used biquaternions to study motion in non-Euclidean manifolds (surfaces), now known as &#8220;Space of Clifford-Klein.&#8221; He showed that spaces of constant curvature could have several different topological structures and proved the topological equivalence of a Rieman surface to a box with holes in it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dimensional Shift</strong>: The ability of executing the changes of dimensions at a singularity in the moment of Now.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>DNA</strong>: Encoding medium that carries all the information cells required to reproduce and plays a vital part in heredity. Thus, DNA, in the Holon Theory, is the messenger or the carrier; rather than the encoder of the logic-information. The encoder, or the Co-Creator, is the informed free will within the process of involution-evolution. Here, informed knowledge is the encoded involution logic, which is non-locally connected to the Creation logic that in turn has its correspondence to the logic of the First Cause. The encoder or the Co-Creator is the actualization process known as evolution-involution. (See First Cause, Evolution-Involution, and Embryology)</p>
<p>With respect to the logic-information component of the DNA, the following findings of Dr. Merrill Garnett, stated in the website <a href="http://www.geocities.com/garnettmckeen/">www.geocities.com/garnettmckeen/</a>, is related. <em>Garnett&#8217;s electro-analytic measurements reveal the presence of a second genetic code by which DNA segments and cell membranes exchange ultra-low frequency sinusoidal currents. His theory is that these pulsed currents are the basis of all physiologic pulses and determine the polarization, charge, and folding of enzymes, nucleic acids, and membrane phospholipids. …</em><strong> </strong><em>There is a traditional DNA based genetic code. Nevertheless, I have found the dynamic corollaries of the genetic code. This second code governs energy exchange and is the electronic receiver and transmitter of DNA. When it gets out of alignment, it can no longer exchange energy and</em><strong> </strong><em>we die. Dead things have only the first code; live things have both codes. …</em><strong> </strong><em>The second code is a musical program of repeated phrases which re-phrases combinations throughout life. It requires alignment of the nucleosomes for transmission. These are specially coiled chromatin. They form a series inductance electronic device and send 50 milivolt signals to the catalytic centers of certain enzymes at ultra-low resonant frequencies.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doppelganger</strong>: (See Astroprojection)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dowsing</strong>: To search for a source of water or minerals or a yes/no answer to a question with a divining rod. In the Holon Theory, Dowsing is a method that helps to awaken one’s spirit knowingness by the use of a divining rod. A divining rod can be nearly any material from a live tree branch to glass, aluminum or copper.</p>
