				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GENESIS</strong></p>
<p><em>And the Lord God <strong>formed </strong></em><em>man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>[And the Lord God Created by Involution Logic, which directs the Evolution of a man.]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>God Formed &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Created Logic</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dust of the Ground &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Evolution guided by Involution</strong></li>
<li><strong>Involution Logic of </strong><strong>身</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>心</strong><strong>-</strong>靈<strong>; namely extending the Logic of a living body (</strong><strong>身</strong><strong>) to include the logic of Intellectual Love in Man’s Heart (</strong><strong>心</strong><strong>) guided by the Brain-Spirit of </strong>靈 (<strong>in </strong><strong>身</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>心</strong><strong>-</strong>靈<strong>) that has the image of God’s </strong>靈 (<strong>in </strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄</strong><strong>)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper for him</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>[And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; without some one of his kind to Love; I will make him a lover]</strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</em></p>
<p><em>And the rib, which the Lord had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>[And the Lord God Created the Logic of a Woman, a Soul Mate] </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>[The Logic of a Woman is part of the Logic of Adam; with a Soul Mate Body </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>身</strong><strong>) to correspond to the logic of Unconditional Love in a Woman’s Heart (</strong><strong>心</strong><strong>) guided by the Brain Soul of </strong><strong>魂</strong><strong> (in </strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄</strong><strong>)]</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, Man has the Involution logic of a Left-Brain, while Woman has the involution logic of a Right Brain. Both Man and Woman forming the Soul Mate of each other are created by a dual set of logic; namely left-right Brain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Within the Logic of Soul Mate, God also Created the Logic of Reproduction to bring forth children. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Man &#8212;&gt;</strong><strong> Image of God: When Man become his own Soul Mate, i.e., Right Brain and Left Brain fused into Spirit Knowingness, then man’s body </strong><strong>身</strong><strong> will be immortal and fused with </strong><strong>魄</strong><strong> (in </strong><strong>靈</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魂</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>魄</strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally, the Soul-Spirit physiology for Humans is diagrammed in the Mandala shown below.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-4419" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=4419"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4419" title="tem-2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tem-29.jpeg" alt="tem-2" width="489" height="686" /></a>Notice, number 6 is in image of number 9 but 180 degree out of phase as shown in the mandala below.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-4422" href="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/?attachment_id=4422"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4422" title="tem-2" src="http://holon137.com/Matter-BeingProject/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/tem-210.jpeg" alt="tem-2" width="468" height="474" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The reason for this 180 degree out of phase is because God started the Creation with Spirit and collapsed downward. On the other hand, Human&#8217;s return path to God  is a reverse engineering process starting from the collapsed Information-Energy body and ascending upward.<br />
