				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I shall apply the Matter-Being Paradigm to resolve the mysteries hidden in God&#8217;s Six-Days of Creation. First three days is the subject matter of this posting, while the next 3-days and the 7th day rest will be the subject matter of my next posting. Perhaps, the 6-days of Creation expressed in the Bible is God&#8217;s application of the Holon Theory in Matter-Being Paradigm, at least as interpreted by this Observer. After all, what this Observer observed was Created by God.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The six-day period of the creation of our Universe is surprisingly formulated in the following Holon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The First 3-Days &#8212;&gt; Lock Logic<br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Second 3-Days &#8212;&gt; Key Logic</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Seventh Day &#8212;&gt; Lock-Key Formation (the Big Bang: Logic-Information Crossover onto Information-Energy, Information-Energy Collapsed onto Energy-Mass)<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This Holon is God&#8217;s Free Will, which generated the Holon execution. Thus free will is the self-programming component of God&#8217;s Vacuum Computer.<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF CREATION</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>We cannot know God as a person. We can only try to understand God from His creation. In this and the next postings, I will explain the six days of creation from my understanding of God from His Lock-Key Holon encoded in the Pre- and Post-Octagons, and His Free Will encoded in the thought octagon as derived in this Paradigm. The following interpretation must be viewed in the context of non-local logic. Remember, the term &#8220;non-local&#8221; implies spaceless and timeless influences. The term &#8220;logic&#8221; has to do with the contents of God&#8217;s mind, at least my interpretation of the logic formulated in God&#8217;s mind by following the meanings embedded in the thought octagon (with free will in neutral lines); where 1 corresponds to beauty, 2 corresponds to binary logic (simplicity), and 3 corresponds to ternary logic (least action). And 2 will use the binary logic as symbolized by the yin and the yang lines, while the ternary logic is denoted by a trigram of either yin or yang as formulated in the Paradigm for the logic of elementary particles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is significant to understand that God&#8217;s creation is a non-local universe or the archetypal (the mandala) universe. That is to say, all Six Days of Creation happened simultaneously. It is due to the linear nature in the human language that God&#8217;s creation was described day by day in the Book of Genesis. It is also significant to understand that the material items, such as sun, moon, grass, and so on as stated in the Book of Genesis imply the logic components of what these items symbolized. For example, to me, the sun symbolizes light activated by the light particle called photon, while the moon symbolizes &#8220;weak or invisible light&#8221; activated by the particles referred to as weak bosons. The logic aspect of these light-particles is formulated as bigrams/tetragrams of yin, yang and neutral lines. Another example, to me the separation of dryness from wetness symbolizes the separation of spirit, or logic (dryness or steadfast), from soul, or the transformation of logic into information or the wave (wetness or watery). With this understanding, the Six Days of Creation can fit beautifully into the Holon Theory of Creation from the thought octagon, the pre-heaven octagon and the post-heaven octagon. I can now express, in the following, my opinion of each individual day of the creation from the context of the Holon Theory within the Matter-Being Paradigm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The First Day of Creation:</strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning God  created the heaven and the earth.</em></p>
<p><strong>[In the beginning God  created the pre-heaven, or lock logic and the post-heaven, or key logic  of the non-local component of matter. Remember, again both lock and key  logic were created simultaneously, at an instant.]</strong></p>
<p><em>And the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</em></p>
<p><strong>[God created the Yin-Logic. Literally, yin corresponds to darkness]</strong></p>
<p><em>And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</em></p>
<p><strong>[With the reflection from the face of the darkness]</strong></p>
<p><em>And God said, Let there by light; and there was light.</em></p>
<p><strong>[God created the reflectiveness of yin or the opposite of the logic of darkness, which is the Yang-Logic, namely the logic of light or the photon]</strong></p>
<p><em>And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.</em></p>
<p><strong>[God formed the logic of light and darkness, symbolized by the bigram of Yin and Yang]</strong></p>
<p><em>And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Second Day of Creation:</strong></p>
<p><em>And God said, Let there by a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</em></p>
<p><strong>[God formed a mirror with the firmament in the midst of the waters, and the mirror divided the water from the waters.]</strong></p>
<p><em>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters, which were under the firmament from the water, which were above the firmament; and it was so.</em></p>
<p><strong>[God divided the waters, which were under the mirror from the waters, which were above the mirror, and it was so.</strong>]</p>
<p><em>And God called the firmament Heaven. </em>And the evening and the morning were the second day.</p>
<p><strong>The Third Day of Creation:</strong></p>
<p><em>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.</em></p>
<p><strong>[God separated the symmetry of dryness from wetness]</strong></p>
<p><em>And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good.</em></p>
<p><strong>[The dryness becomes the Logic, Archetypal/gestalt, or the Universe of the Spirit; and the wetness corresponds to the information/topology, or the soul universe of continuous transformation.]</strong></p>
<p><em>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth; and it was so.</em></p>
<p><strong>[And God said, let the logic universe bring forth the logic of grass, the logic of herb yielding seed, and it was so.]</strong></p>
<p><em>And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seeds after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind; and God saw that was good.</em></p>
<p><strong>[And he Logic of all these co-created the Lock-Logic component of matter.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>God in the first three days created the pre-heaven binary logic of yin and yang, the pre-heaven ternary logic symbolized by the trigrams, and arranged into the beauty of a pre-heaven, lock-logic octagon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, in the first three days, the lock-logic in God&#8217;s free will created the pre-heaven logic and encoded the thought octagon. This set of pre-heaven logic represents the lock-logic component of matter.</strong></p>
