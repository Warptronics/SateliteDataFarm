<p><strong>The Chinese Character for Wind is Feng.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>FENG</em>: The Meaning of Wind in Chinese Medicine. http://www.itmonline.org/articles/feng/feng.htm. W<em>ith special attention to acupoint fengchi (GB-20). by Subhuti Dharmananda, Ph.D., Director, Institute for Traditional Medicine, Portland, Oregon</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“A term in the field of traditional Chinese medicine that causes considerable difficulty for modern practitioners is wind (feng).  It is known as:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>one of the six external      causes of disease (six qi or six yin);</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>one of the conditions      associated with the five elements systematic correspondences (wind      associated with the wood element); </em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>an entity that has an      external and an internal origin, associated with diagnostic categories;      and</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>one of the terms used in      acupuncture point names, such as fengchi      (GB-20), fengfu (GV-16), fengmen (BL-12), and fengshi (GB-31).</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>“The use of this term feng is so widespread and mysterious that a modern text on the underlying meaning of acupuncture point names is titled: “Grasping the Wind (1).”  Certainly, to understand basic Chinese medical thinking sufficiently to carry out an Oriental medicine practice, one must grasp the meaning of wind.” </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“A difficulty with the term wind is that it is widely and freely used in the Orient in relation to health and disease, while it has no equivalent meaning or implication for Westerners in the medical field.  A patient unfamiliar with the use of the term may be told, “your condition involves wind,” or this treatment is for “wind-heat.”  The puzzling reference to a weather condition may call for explanation.   An appropriate depiction of the Chinese concept can set the stage for better appreciation of the Chinese tradition.  On the other hand, an unacceptable depiction can lead to even greater suspicion of the foreign concepts employed in the sometimes bizarre medical tradition that includes cupping, blood letting, inserting over a dozen needles in the body, and ingestion of large combinations of herbs.”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Modern Diseases Clarifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“diseases involving excess      movement of the body: epilepsy (rare convulsions) and Parkinson’s disease;</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>diseases involving symptoms      appearing in different parts of the body at different times: early stage      rheumatism involving differing joints or skin rashes that appear in      different places;</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>diseases involving loss of      movement: stroke, paralysis, tetany, and coma;</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>various pain, numbness, and      spastic syndromes, sometimes referred to as bi syndromes, including headache, toothache, limb      numbness, tendon spasms, arthritis, deep bone pain;</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>diseases that are acute:      common cold, influenza, sinus infection, skin eruption, sore throat,      cough, eye disorders; and</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>diseases that affect the      surface of the body (skin or flesh, rather than viscera): chronic eczema, leprosy,      scrofula, hair loss.”</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>“In the field of modern medicine, a number of causative factors have been identified for the “wind” disorders of concern, including infectious agents, neurological problems, and autoimmune diseases.  Despite progress in scientific analysis, the reason that a disease has arisen in any individual may remain difficult to pin down; further, the manifestations among different patients varies, sometimes markedly.  None of the modern explanations for the cause or manifestation of the diseases and disorders inherently contradicts the traditional Chinese concept that they are caused by wind or somehow involve wind, but the explanations do seem more detailed and up to date.  The availability of modern explanations raises the question of how useful the ancient terminology is when it comes to understanding the disease and deciding upon the method of treatment.  Thus, it is important to get a sense of how much reliance there is upon the basic concept of wind in the Chinese system.” </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>In short, Wind (Feng) is a Pre-Quantum concept on Local&#8212;Non-Local Health as conceived by the Chinese, expressed in the Classic of the Nei-Ching.<br />

<p><strong>THE PRE-HEAVEN HOLON</strong></p>
<p><strong>Holon HC (&#8212;-&gt; Ck-7—Ck-4—Ck-2) identifies the Local—Non-Local Involution Logic of the individual encoded in the Vacuum Computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE POST-HEAVEN HOLON</strong></p>
<p><strong> Holon Tw (&#8212;&gt; Ck-6—Ck5—Ck-1) indicates the stability Logic of the individual’s Local—Non-Local Health, defined by the difference between Logic of Now the Involution Logic encoded in the Vacuum Computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE FENG ACU-POINTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>The order of these points listed below have no significant. The point descriptions are quoted from the book <em>Grasping The Wind</em> by Andrew Ellis, Nigel Wiseman, and Ken Boss.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>SI-12: Grasping the Wind (bing feng), A deep depression is found at this spot when the arm is raised. An invasion of external wind can get caught in this depression and cause shoulder disorders. In a manner of speaking, the point catches or “grasps” the wind. SI-12 is treated to relieve this type of shoulder pain accompanied by inability to raise the arm.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Bl-12: Wind Gate (feng men), Bl-12 is called Wind Gate both because wind pathogens enter the body there, and because the point can be used to treat exterior wind patterns. The alternate names feng fu, Wind Mansion, and Heat Mansion, slso reflect this line of reasoning.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Tw-17: Wind Screen (yi feng), This point is located behind the ear, which acts as a screen for the point, shading it and protecting it from the wind. In addition, the point may be utilized to dispel wind, thus screening the body from wind pathogens.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>GB-20: Wind Pool (feng chi), The depression in which GB-20 is located resembles a pool in the landscape of the body. Wind pathogens are said to collect in this depression, and the point is used in the treatment wind disease.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>GB-31: Wind Market (feng shi), Wind disorders can be treated by applying acupuncture or moxibustion at this point. Furthermore, wind qi may gather in this area like people gathering at a market or fair.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>GV-16: Wind Mansion (feng fu), This point is used to treat wind disorders such as wind strike, stiff neck, headache, aversion to cold, visual dizziness, hemiplegia, head wind and wind cold. It teats both endogenous or exogenous wind, especially when that wind affects the brain. GV-16 is further considered to be appoint at which wind pathogens enter the body.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>CV-4 (guan yuan, dan tian, …, </em></strong><strong>26 alternative names), <em>Depending on which meaning of the character guan is considered, CV-4 is a “passageway of original qi </em>(&#8212;&gt; Ch’i)” <em>the “ critical juncture of original yang and original yin,” or the place where “original qi is stored” [locked in</em> &#8212;&gt; </strong><strong>computer encoded<em>]. The rendering of this name as Origin Pass is an attempt to include all these ideas.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The plethora of alternate names for this point are a result of it being the site of uterus (i.e., blood chamber), the cinnabar field (dan tian), and the life gate fire.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>CV-17 (dan zhong), This point is named after its location in the center of the chest. The Spiritual Axis calls this area of the body the “palace of the heart governor </em></strong><strong>[Heart Constrictor, HC. This point identifies who you are, namely, the you encoded inside the Vacuum Computer]. <em>This may</em> <em>explain the imperial nature of the point names in the region.</em></strong></p>
