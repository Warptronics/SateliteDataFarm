				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>When I was a small boy, I used to gaze at the sun and I would enjoy following the patch of various colors that appeared afterwards.<br />When the sun was high in the sky (I live in a very sunny area) I would observe the patches of light on the moving leaves. That used to impress me a lot. I used to tell myself I was witnessing the manifestation of supernatural beings.</p>
<p>As I used to sit down on my own on the veranda during sunny afternoons, I used to have the impression that shadows were passing in front of me. I would jump to see who it was and, of course, would never find anything. However, I was certain I had seen someone. My mother started to tell me stories about dwarves, leprechauns, genies… and I even remember that she mentioned that if we observed the moon for a long enough time, we would see a foot appear. So, in the evenings, I started to gaze at the moon in secret while recalling all those stories.</p>
<p>I started to have amazing dreams; they were dreams of great adventures and, in the morning, I would feel so filled with joy that I would sometimes try to enact them (it is only later, thanks to Phosphenism, that I understood what provoked them).</p>
<p>Later, my interest moved towards the paranormal and aliens, amongst other things. I was very young but the films and the documentaries on these subjects used to attract me, to enthrall me, to fascinate me. Then, I started to experience dreams of flying. During those dreams, I was often a female character. I was being chased and would end up blocked by a chasm. I would then decide to step over it and would start flying like the Iron Man.</p>
<p>These recurring dreams started to scare me because in our african traditions, taking off in a dream is assimilated to practicing sorcery, unlike other cultures that assimilate it to spiritual awakening…</p>
<p>Consequently, I never mentioned these experiences. I only cared for the fact that they would produce a feeling of indescribable joy and power. Let me mention that, at school, I was a clever boy, gifted with a good memory and that I obtained good results with no real difficulty.</p>
<p>Later, I discovered a new passion: fishing. I come from a forested region of Ivory Coast where there are many rivers and watercourses. We used to fish during the entire school holidays. I remember that we used to leave in the morning and come back in the evening, happy to have enjoyed good moments. During that period, my taste for occultism started to take shape and I started to read books and attend seminars.</p>
<p>I was driven by a thirst, a need for the mysterious, the wondrous and that allowed me to make my way into the domain of esotericism. One day, I told a famous clairvoyant of the difficulties I had to concentrate and to remember my dreams. He told me: ‟I am going to tell you a secret but, keep it for yourself. Lock yourself up in a dark room, light a candle, focus on the flame, then close your eyes. Do this for roughly twenty minutes and see the effects for yourself”.<br />I did what he advised and my capacity to foresee events became sharper and sharper.</p>
<p>I discovered the term ‟phosphene” for the first time in Anthor&#8217;s book ‟A Practical Guide to Spiritual Awakening”. I enjoyed that book, as it comforted me in the direction I was following. Then, one day, I discovered the Phosphenism website and the “Phosphenic Energy Universe” magazine. It was as if my entire life found meaning again, as if I could understand everything.</p>
<p>Doctor Lefebure is at the same time one of the most important scientific and spiritual researcher, as well as a prophet who has inaugurated a new era where mystification and obscurantism are obsolete. Thanks to Phosphenism, thousands of years of initiatory secrets are unveiled. Initiatory knowledge can finally be understood and accessed by all. Science and Initiation have, at last, found a common ground.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>The term tarot is a word that can be reversed: ROTA, meaning wheel. It is a divinatory game composed of 22 major arcana and 56 minor arcana. The arcana of the tarot, with their symbolism, constitute messages emanating from our deepest subconscious and from the collective unconscious, common to all humanity. No one really knows the precise origin of these cards, nor the exact signification that the had whey they first appeared.</p>
<p>However, everyone tries to interpret them haphazardly, being conscious of the profound initiatory message carried by the arcana. The first trump card of the tarot is called the Juggler. Its signification, which is usually very important, is provided by Franz Bardon in his book ‟The Path of the True Magical Initiation”. Dr Fernand Rozier has also used it on the cover of his book, ‟A Course of High Magic”.</p>
<p>The Juggler is also called the Magician, i. e. he who realizes the quadrupole magnet, the divine tetragrammaton, mastery over the four elements. In the concept of magic, the four elements are the basis of initiatory development as they constitute the basic stones with which the mage builds. Traditionally, they are fire, water, air and earth. But, these elements actually are the four verbs of initiation: to dare, to want, to know, to be silent.</p>
<p>Initiatory knowledge is not a mystification, it is based on laws and principles that anyone can experiment with. Daring is the force that allows the student, who wants to become a mage, to delve into the conquest of the unknown by banishing fear and doubt.</p>
<p>But, a mage is not ephemeral nor is he fanatical, as all the aspects of his behavior on the path are regulated by a tested knowledge. He remains silent because everyone thinks he is only a wandering entertainer, a prestidigitator, nothing more.</p>
<p>Today, Dr Lefebure&#8217;s works can help us understanding the rationality hidden behind certain initiatory secrets. To understand that, one needs to explain in detail the signification of the Juggler.</p>
<p>A young man, full of confidence is represented on the trump. In front of him, there is a table with various objects. With one hand, he indicates the sky, with the other one, he points at the earth. That is simply the expression of the old hermetic saying: ‟As above, so below”.</p>
<p>The signification of this trump is usually only understood by those who are taking their first steps on the path of the occult. What most people do not know, is that this understanding actually constitutes the theoretical aspect of the Juggler. Its initiatory signification is even more profound and concrete.<strong> The Juggler faces the rising sun</strong>. It is obvious because that position allows him to have a better visibility, his game being a game of skill. He gazes at the horizon and, consequently cannot avoid looking at the sun: <strong>he is thus doing a phosphene.</strong></p>
<p>Considering the very efficient role of phosphenes in personal development, one can understand where the Juggler finds his serenity, his skill and the quality of mage that is attributed to him.</p>
<p>On his head there is a large hat, showing that he is protected from the sun and can do phosphenes safely.</p>
<p>The shape of his hat is characteristic and many occultists want to interpret it as the symbol of infinity, as if it indicated infinity. Actually, the Juggler is performing rotations and figure-of-8 head sways.<br />The Ancients, with this simple trump, clearly indicate the path of the true initiation, which, today, is accessible by all.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Juggler is one of the most famous phosphenauts, though not many persons realize that. Indeed, today, many people still want to interpret everything as symbols instead of analyzing things in a simpler manner. Phosphenism, as indicated by the Juggler, is <em><strong>the path of the true magical initiation.</strong></em></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>The crisis following the latest elections in Ivory Coast is without precedent in the development of a young nation. The extreme violence that has accompanied that crisis has plunged many inhabitants of the country in a sort of psychosis that grows worse every day. Between the crackle of the firearms and the sound of the cannon, the craziest manifestations have been reported throughout the country!</p>
<p>From the manifestation of a heart-shaped symbol in a bowl of soup to the perception of a cloud in the courtyard of the Ministry of Defense or the manifestation of rainbow colors emitted by a statue of the Virgin Mary, all these ‟manifestations” were attributed to divine phenomena and, for some, announced the forthcoming end of the crisis.</p>
<p>That is how, several days before the fall of the previous regime, I became the witness of an event that I shall share with you here.</p>
<p>I live in Marcory, one of the upper-end neighborhoods of Abidjan. It is an area that has not suffered from the fighting during the crisis, but that has been subjected to much looting. Like some other inhabitants, I decided to remain in Abidjan during the last moments of the crisis.</p>
<p>The event I am referencing to took place on April 8th 2011 at approximately 4 PM. As the access to our city had been blocked off, it was possible to get around the streets without risking to be hit by a random shot or to encounter an armed mob.</p>
<p>That day, down the street, through my window, I heard shouts of joy, happiness, as well as weeping. I decided to have a peep outside to find out the reason for such an uproar. That is when<strong> I saw a crowd, gathered together, gazing at the sun</strong>. The crowd was composed of men, women and children who were competing for a good spot, as the trees and the buildings hindered the observation of the sun. I thus came out of my house to see what was going on in the sky.</p>
<p>I joined the crowd to gaze at the sun. After a period of gazing, a blue ring formed around the sun. It seemed to darken shortly afterwards. I could hear voices in the crowd say: ‟The sun becomes blue, it is the color of the Virgin Mary”. Others were saying: ‟The color changes, it becomes pink or red, God is really wondrous”. For other persons, the light of the sun was becoming brighter. A short while afterwards, the sun seemed to rotate and to change position. It is at that moment that I heard the crowd say: ‟It&#8217;s falling, no, it&#8217;s rotating! It&#8217;s a miracle, God is supporting us during the crisis”. I saw a very agitated woman that claimed that she had seen the face of the Holy Virgin. Her eyes were full of tears. A second person, older and standing closer to me was agreeing wholeheartedly with her: ‟Yes, it is truly Mary, mother! Please deliver us!”.</p>
<p>I cannot relate all the feelings that were expressed that day, as they were many and diverse. But, it is with a feeling of gratitude toward Dr LEFEBURE that I assisted to that event. Though on a smaller scale, that event can be compared with the events of Fatima (Portugal) in 1917. The solar prodigy and manifestation of the Virgin in Fatima has been deciphered by Dr LEFEBURE. It is possible to compare the two events, in the light of Dr LEFEBURE&#8217;s explanations.</p>
<p>The various phenomena that I related above correspond to the behavior of phosphenes, as indicated in Dr LEFEBURE&#8217;s works.</p>
<p>Here are the explanations provided by the phosphenes about those ‟divine manifestations”.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; The blue ring around the sun:</strong> that stage corresponds to the co-phosphene. If you focus on a lamp for three minutes, you will see certain colors appear in succession, starting with a pale blue tint. That is why certain persons claimed that blue was the color of the Holy Virgin. Then, pink spots appear. They correspond to another phase of the co-phosphene, and that explains why the crowd claimed that the sun was turning red. Finally the colors of the phosphene evolve towards green and then grey.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; The rotating sun:</strong> that stage corresponds to one of the rhythms of the phosphene, the trembling at a rhythm of 1/6th of a second. It can sometimes be perceived when you are gazing at the sun. According to Dr LEFEBURE, the main interest of this rhythm is that it can resonate with the oscillations of the muscles, that follow the same rhythm. It then generates amazingly beautiful phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; The image of the Virgin Mary:</strong> a phenomenon of phosphenic telepathy has occurred; an induction of rhythmic thinking that provokes the perception of images in the individual who receives it. The lady, who was certainly very pious and who placed the image of the Holy Virgin in the center of the sun ended up transmitting that image to the persons around her. </p>
<p>I have to admit that I found those experiences very amusing because the participants were determined to believe that they had a divine origin. I then understood that Phosphenism is a light that can help us see clearer on the dark path of our ignorance.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>The term self-fulfillment can be used to describe individuals who have gone through the various stages of their path of life to approach the realization of the needs of their soul.</strong></p>
<p>According to Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, <strong>we experience, in the first place, physiological needs of security, of belonging, of self-esteem and finally, needs of accomplishment.</strong> The process of self-fulfillment thus constitutes the highest step. The most important element for reaching this highest step is the determination of vision. Vision is our primary vocation, our “raison d&#8217;être”, the true reason behind our existence. As soon as they are unique in some way, human beings constitute a centerpiece in the evolutionary process of humanity.</p>
<p>Each and everyone of us come to this world with a mission to accomplish, a destiny to fulfill. Though everyone generally admits that fact, most of us experience difficulties in determining which sector they belong to. If you are one of those, here are a few instructions for you. What gifts and qualities of yours are recognized by others, what do you like to do, in what or in which context do you accomplish yourself best?</p>
<p>An objective answer to these questions will allow you to determine your vision. Vision can also be found hidden behind the main flaws of an individual, as a flaw is always a quality that is not expressed the right way. Vision can also be chosen in a rational and objective manner. Thus, after reflecting upon their own needs and the needs of others, individuals can decide to position themselves in the direction of fulfilling those needs. To be efficient, vision should be based on love rather than on the effervescent search for profit. Otherwise, it becomes nothing more than ambition.</p>
<p>The essential principle that needs to be remembered is that vision motivated by love has a future, it only needs men and women to take shape. Vision is indeed very important but, it does not automatically leads to distinction. Vision allows us to determine the domain to which we belong (medicine, teaching, business…).<br />It is our dreams that determine the amplitude of our vision. In other words, the mental image that we have of our vision will create the difference between us and the other individuals. That is why self-fulfillment is a relative and personal notion. It is nothing more than the realization of what the individual tends toward.</p>
<p>In any case, to achieve genuine fulfillment, an individual needs knowledge. Knowledge is a gathering of information that allows to overcome the obstacles encountered by the individual. It allows projections and the anticipation of events. It also permits originality and helps adapting to all situations.</p>
<p>Discipline is very important in the process of self-fulfillment, it constitutes the strength and the soul of all great armies. It allows the introduction of military rigor to our attitude in life, in a practical way. It consists in using the “no” option when it is necessary and to take into account the notions of time and space in our actions. Thanks to discipline, our work will produce durable results and we will reach the maximum of our abilities. Without discipline, we produce a lot of efforts and achieve little results. Consequently, it becomes almost impossible to maintain ourselves at our peak.</p>
<p>The last important factor to be taken into account is assiduity: diligent work allows us to realize the needs of our soul. Someone once said that work is worth genius. Conscientious work is the best way to attain self-fulfillment. In this world, there is no future for the lazy. Whatever the grandeur of your vision, if you do not do anything, nothing will happen. Refusing to work is depriving ourselves of 60% of our chances of success. Working in the direction of our own self-fulfillment is, for sure, the best way to achieve it.<br />Self-fulfillment can become a reality if we decide to use these guidelines with wisdom. Phosphenism can help us greatly. Phosphenism consists in focusing on a source of light for a short time, then to close your eyes and observe the image of retinal persistence.</p>
<p>That important technique was discovered by Dr Lefebure. He also had the idea of associating a thought to the phosphene, thus creating Phosphenic Mixing. Phosphenes can help us a lot on our path of self-fulfillment as they tend to densify thoughts and to develop what the individual tends toward. On that subject, Dr Lefebure says: <strong>“HE WHO THINKS WHILE GAZING AT THE SUN BECOMES A SUN IN SOCIETY”.</strong></p></div>

<p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p>
<p>Psalmody is essentially characterized by the regularity and the constancy of its practice.<br />Psalmody is essentially characterized by the regularity and the constancy of its practice. In the Tradition, the words chosen for repetition are linked to the period of the day or the night; they are set in predetermined time-slots that should be respected as much as possible, even if certain particular circumstances allow the possibility to make some exceptions.</p>
<p>The practice of Psalmody should be very regular, cyclic and continuous in order to be efficient.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>The objectives assigned to psalmody are specific and varied.<br />One of the first objectives is the serenity acquired with time and experience. Also, if the modalities and conditions are respected, Psalmody leads to various states of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>PRACTICING PSALMODY</strong></p>
<p>Psalmody has an endless source of words at its disposal, various in content and form, that can be chosen according to the results that the individual wants to obtain.<br />The duration of a session of Psalmody can go from a few minutes to hours. Night sessions are more profitable because of the atmosphere of calm that prevails.<br />Psalmody can be practice alone, in a partial or total state of isolation; it can also be practiced collectively at particular moments, just before sunrise and at dusk, especially in inter-tropical regions.</p>
<p>Psalmody can have a religious character or be purely meditative.</p>
<p><strong>PSALMODY REQUIRES CERTAIN NECESSARY CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>The essential conditions for practicing Psalmody:</p>
<p>The first condition is the choice of an appropriate environment: a healthy, clean place, indoors or outdoors.<br />The individual should wear clean clothes, his body should also have been purified with water.<br />The session of recitation is accompanied by the simultaneous visualization of images related to the words.<br />Respect of the instructions lead the individual to levels of operationality.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATIONALITIES</strong></p>
<p>The individual internalizes progressively the content of the recited words.<br />The recited words take shape and life and are internalized by the individual.<br />The words turn into images and often take precise shapes that accompany the recited words.<br />The individual attains a level of skill with visualization where words and images are integrated together.<br />Precision should be the norm for the words, the sounds that are emitted and the number of times they are repeated.</p>
<p>The practice of Psalmody follows certain steps:</p>
<p><strong>THE STEPS</strong></p>
<p>The first stage of initiation allows the individuals to familiarize themselves to the outlines of Psalmody.<br />Regular practice of Psalmody develops much perseverance and allows the observation of many results.<br />Determination and consistency in practice inevitably lead to the obtention of a high level of expertise.</p>
<p>Psalmody is a cross-sector process.</p>
<p><strong>A CROSS-SECTOR PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>Psalmody is similar to Phosphenism, in particular for their capacity to link words to images and to feed the reflection process.<br />With the practice of Psalmody, the soul can be freed and travel.<br />Moreover, the individual can attain a level that produces out-of-body experiences or consciousness extensions.<br />At the end of the day, Psalmody is a very ancient practice of meditation, concentration and invocation.</p>
<p>Psalmody presents specific and particular characteristics that can also be found in the practice of Phosphenism.</p>
<p>To be efficient, Psalmody should respect the same laws as phosphenic exercises of rhythmic thinking.<br /><strong>Summary:</strong><br />Regularity of rhythm = neurological connections = elevation of the level of consciousness.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Education can be defined as a set of methods which purpose is to transmit knowledge to an individual (child or adult). It is, first and foremost, the action of directing the student on the path of learning.</p>
<p>If the scientific aspect of modern educational teaching differs from the teaching provided by traditional societies, the latter have always transmitted knowledge to the youth around a fire or during the full moon. These customs are apparently strongly related to Phosphenic Mixing, a technique that consists in combining a thought with a phosphene produced by focusing on a source of light for a short time.</p>
<p>With regard to these traditions, could Phosphenic Mixing always have been used in Africa, for the transmission of knowledge to the new generations? What is the state of application of that traditional method today?</p>
<p><strong>I/ A teaching method related to Phosphenic Mixing</strong></p>
<p>As far as the memory of traditional african societies can go, no knowledge related to cosmogony, legends or history has been transmitted without the presence of a source of light (Fire, the Sun, the Moon). The great cosmic truths were disclosed during initiations performed around large fires. After the physical trials, the candidates presented themselves in front of a large fire with enormous flames, in order to receive teachings that, for a long time, were hidden from the profane. This sheds a new light on certain spiritual realities.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the transmission of knowledge was purely oral and, consequently, that it had to be engraved permanently in the memory of the learners.</p>
<p>In our villages, during the telling of stories around the fire, we used to learn social values that we had to integrate in our behavior. Our eyes were fixed on the flames that undulated ceaselessly. And our thoughts followed these rhythms. Sometimes, we would perceive images stemming from the depths of our selves.</p>
<p>Moonlight, the starry sky, also represented chances of learning and being creative. That is why these moments were favorable to the experimentation of new games for young girls and boys. It was rather common for a young child to identify his/herself to a star or another celestial object.</p>
<p>Focusing on sources of light has doubtlessly influenced positively the political, social and cultural development of our societies, whether consciously or unconsciously. The African griots <em>(an oral historian, guardian of the village and of the genealogy of its inhabitants)</em> in the Manding <em>(the Mandingues being a group of populations living in Western Africa)</em> learnt the history of great men by practicing Phosphenic Mixing. It was also the case with craftsmen, weavers, sculptors, potters… who have experienced an amplification of their inspiration thanks to that method.<br />However, modern educational teaching methods have neglected that technique.</p>
<p><strong>II/ The loss of the method of Phosphenic Mixing because of colonization</strong></p>
<p>The educational system inherited from colonization has been the demise of that method. Our governments have tried many different educational systems ending up today with the method by competence. Such a multiplicity of methods of education reveals a difficulty: the search for a suitable educational method in order to improve the results of students and schoolchildren. However, with the new, so-called evolutive methods, the success rate in our schools has diminished, year by year. Flaws and deviations in our societies soon follow: school failure, corruption, decline of moral values. These situations are the consequence of neglecting an educational method that makes use of Phosphenic Mixing. That method used to contribute to the development of a human being as a whole, intellectually as well as spiritually.</p>
<p>These days are an era of technology and information characterized by the appearance of various tools for simplifying learning. However, there is so much failure! It even claimed that gaming consoles or pen and paper games are adequate means to preserve the freshness of our memory.<br />In view of such a situation, Phosphenic Mixing appears as a sane alternative, natural and durable. Hence the necessity to valorize or re-valorize it in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>III/ Valorizing learning with Phosphenic Mixing</strong></p>
<p>Today, Dr Lefebure&#8217;s research has demonstrated that Phosphenic Mixing (i.e. learning by combining a thought with focusing on a source of light) was the foundation of the influence of Egyptian, Greek and Roman civilizations. Our traditional societies also used to utilize that technique, consciously or not, for transmitting knowledge.</p>
<p>Dr LEFEBURE has underscored that the decline of the civilizations mentioned came to pass because they had abandoned or forbidden that practice. Consequently, to save Africa from destruction, it is necessary to use that learning method. It is not new, as it is actually the foundation of civilization.</p>
<p>The appropriation of Phosphenic Mixing by Africa will help raising the level of education, increasing the rate of alphabetization, optimizing creativity, among other things. In Ivory Coast for instance, the rate of success to the Baccalaureate exam was 20% in 2009 against 38% in 2008. In 2010 that rate went back up to 24,51%. Everything seems to show that it is the system itself that is unhealthy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Education, teaching and Phosphenic Mixing can be made compatible in order to lead to a better efficiency. That method certainly has a future in Africa, as it can end the prejudices (confiscation of intelligence, bewitchment…) that are used to explain the school failure of many children.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>In all traditional African societies, there are priests and priestesses, interpreters between two worlds, guardians and protectors of the balance of society. They are often credited with mystical powers, the capacity of driving away demons, healing as well as preserving society of major disasters.</p>
<p>In Ivory Coast, the Akan population, or more precisely the Baoule (the ethnic group I am from) call these priests and priestesses ‟<em><strong>Komian</strong></em>”.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Baoule form the majority of the population of Ivory Coast. They settled in the center of the country after leaving the Ashanti confederation (the equivalent of today&#8217;s Ghana) around the 17th century, because of a military and political war. Measured up to religions of revelation such as Christianity and Islam, the Komians have had much bad press. They are arraigned as Satan worshippers or impostors whose only faith is money.</p>
<p>When I was still child, I used to enjoy watching the Komians perform in my village, Mlan-Kouassikro, in the Bouabe district, the second largest city in Ivory Coast. The Komians&#8217; performances in public are preceded by a preparation. They need to dress up and the musicians that accompany them need to install themselves. The latter, equipped with tom-toms, small bells and various other instruments, play rhythms while waiting for the Komian to come out of his sanctuary. When the Komian comes out, the rhythm of the drums change, from a slow rhythm to a fast one.</p>
<p>The dress of the Komian varies. It can be a simple white loincloth tied on the chest, with a second one covering the hips. The Komian can also wear a red hat adorned with cowries and pieces of mirror. Their skin is anointed with Kaolin while amulets and strings are tied here and there. The Komian holds a fly-whisk. Their ankles are adorned with small bells that emit sounds that follow the rhythm of their dance steps.</p>
<p>During the dances, the Komian, with their arms stretched, rotate like the Whirling Dervishes. That movement matches the accelerating rhythm of the drums.</p>
<p>According to ROUGET, in ‟Music and Trance”, during the ceremonies, it is the accelerating rhythm that opens the muscles, the innards, the head, to the penetration of the expected divinity. The dances performed by the Komian are diverse and varied. They strike the ground at a slow beat and suddenly change the pace, accelerating it. They also emit messages in a clear or obscure language.</p>
<p>Sometimes, during the rotations, a member of the audience enters a trance. It is often claimed that the Komian has transmitted something to that person. Sometimes, the Komian touches a member of the audience to let them enter a state of trance. Kaolin powder and eggs from African chicks are thrown on the faces of the “possessed”, whether to free them from their trance or to help them deliver a message from beyond to the living.</p>
<p>In the light of Dr Lefebure&#8217;s discoveries, we can clarify certain facts that take place during these ceremonies.<br />During their public performance, the Komian practice several exercises related to the phenic system. First, it can be noted that the Komian almost only come out during sunny days. Unconsciously or not, as soon as they come out of the sanctuary,<strong> they gaze up towards the bright sky</strong>, as if they were checking the spirits were present. Without a doubt, the Komian <strong>do a phosphene at that moment</strong>. Indeed, their entire choreography is punctuated by that gesture.<br />Then, they perform something that could be called a rhythmic march, hitting hard the ground with their heel, thus making the bells tied to their feet ring. Hitting the ground with one&#8217;s foot stimulates the <strong>Osteophene</strong>, the phene related to the elastic properties of the skeleton, as well as the <strong>Myophene</strong>, the phene related to muscular activity. According to Dr LEFEBURE, any march or dance creates synchronizations between the cerebral hemispheres. That march is sometimes performed toward the musicians and sometimes toward the audience.<br />Consequently, hearing the sound of the tom-toms in turns in the right and the left ear, stimulates the <strong>Acouphene</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, when the traditional priest performs rotations during the dance, the <strong>Gyrophene </strong>is stimulated, the phene related to the sense of balance. That provokes an amplification of the power of Kundalini.<strong> At that stage, the cerebral rhythms of the Komian are amplified so much that they can transmit rhythmic thoughts and stimulate subtle energies in other people: a thought, fantastic images, the perception of subtle planes or other phenomena. These ceremonies are genuine moments of transmission of energies through phosphenic telepathy and thus constitute an initiation.</strong></p>
<p>We have just seen how an African priest sets into motion the entire phenic system.<br />Phosphenism, we can understand fully facts that used to be an arcane mystery which secret was kept by a caste of initiates.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>For the whole of humanity, fire was a major discovery, that first took place in the land of Africa.<br />The utilization of fire has considerably improved the lifestyle of human beings, particularly in the African continent.<br />Some countries in Africa have known and used fire for long periods of their history.</p>
<p>In the beginning, fire helped trigger the transformation from ‟savage” to ‟human” check ‟genesis” for more information. Though, in ancient times, fire was used mainly for cooking, it was also used a lot for lighting.</p>
<p>The Communities have organized their systems of education in adaptation to the context they were in, serving the objectives of the transmission of knowledge and the sustainability of an original, recognized and dynamic civilization.<br />In every house, it is around the fire that the Oral Tradition has formed its Teaching System. Evening classes gave the opportunity to peerless Teachers to use carefully chosen words to create sounds, images, which, associated to the light of the bright flames, would durably be engraved in the memory of the learners and accompanied them in their somnolence and their deep sleep.</p>
<p>The learners would wake up the next day, having internalized a considerable ancestral knowledge, a remarkable know-how and a sense of measured social behavior.</p>
<p>Light that shines from the fire, associated to the image created by the Master would blend into each other <strong>to produce a phosphene, attracting the children&#8217;s attention and rendering them able to memorize vast domains of the oral and traditional African tradition.</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the cognitive, knowledge spreads to psychomotivity and influences the attitudes towards the members of the Community and to the Environment.</p>
<p>Though oral teaching is still very important, the fact remains that the written word has also known its golden age, by producing countless veteran learners, coming from schools of fire.</p>
<p>In Africa, the schools of fire constitute a very common practice, popular and efficient that is still practiced in the villages.</p>
<p>At dusk and before dawn, a circle of learners surrounds the fire and starts a cacophonous performance, as each student recites, in a loud voice, the particular lesson that he or she is learning, from a sculpted plank of wood, filled with writings in black ink.</p>
<p>With its very good rhythm, the cacophony lets also appear sounds as varied as the voices that rise in the night, during which light streams out, is associated to the images and to the sounds and produces miracles; as, after many years, cohorts of learners progress in their training in education. The learners develop prodigious capacities of memorization, become teachers to perpetuate the tradition and watch over the younger initiates.</p>
<p>The learners overcome important challenges and themselves become masters, recognized by all, their peers included.</p>
<p>In spite of a very fast process of urbanization of Africa, these practices still remain effective, particularly in the most rural areas.</p>
<p>In Africa, the schools of fire are an undisputed reality that handsomely contributes to driving back the bounds of ignorance and to favor the blooming of many well-trained youths, able to face the new challenges that Africa must take up. No doubt that the practice of Phosphenic Mixing will contribute to that.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Phosphenic Mixing is a potent and efficient technique for therapeutic treatment as well as for learning, for children and adults alike.</strong><br />I am a psychotherapist and I conduct training courses in the domain of human resources.<br />Let me recount some of the applications I have used with with patients.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In the domain of psychotherapy</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Deep relaxation</strong></p>
<p>I use Phosphenic Mixing with lateral head sways and the mantra ‟EELLEE”, to relax the patient. The relaxing effect can be felt immediately. To deepen the effect of profound relaxation and the state of modified consciousness, I use the seven colors of the rainbow. I ask the patient to visualize the various lights, starting with the red light, all the way up to the purple light. The patient imagines that his/her body is full of light and radiates the corresponding color (red, orange…) while mixing each color of light with a specific sentence:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Red light:</strong></span> I feel alive, dynamic and in good health;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Orange light:</strong></span> I feel harmonious and radiate a warm communion and benevolence in my relations;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Yellow light:</strong></span> I am awake, spontaneous and creative;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Green light:</strong></span> I respect life and nature;</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Blue light: </strong></span>I am calm and perfectly peaceful;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Indigo light:</strong></span> I am serene and I am overrun by mystical joy;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Purple light:</strong></span> I am calm and serene, I feel connected to the positive energy of the entire universe.<br />Finally, the patient finishes the session with the star phosphene: i.e. the patient looks at the light bulb while moving his/her eyes up, down, right, left, and diagonally, passing by the center. <strong>The patient then feels transformed and perceives several options for solving his/her problems.</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the session, I offer a glass of alkaline, ionized water to the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Developing self-confidence</strong></p>
<p>To develop self-confidence, I use Phosphenic Mixing with anteroposterior head sways with the following sentence: ‟As I am confident, I am me, I exist, I have rights, I express myself, I am responsible, I am powerful, I am kind.”<br />Another example: ‟I can direct my thoughts by telling myself that I am enjoying good results in my studies for this exam.”</p>
<p>Finally, the patient finishes the session with the star phosphene: i.e. the patient looks at the light bulb while moving his/her eyes up, down, right, left, and diagonally, passing by the center. Of course, I explain to the patient the meaning of the sentence he/she has chosen and that corresponds to their current objective or to the problem they want to solve.</p>
<p>For instance: I am me means that I have my own values, beliefs and needs to satisfy. And, it is up to me to do it, solely for myself, among the others, rather than for the others, neither against them. I am responsible for my well-being, for my actions.</p>
<p><em>I am powerful</em> means that I am conscious of my feelings, of my emotions, of my thoughts and that I express them in the here and now. I state what I think and I do as I say. I feel coherent and harmonious.</p>
<p><em>I have rights </em>means that I have the right to exist, to have needs, I have the right to express what I want to express, I take my place, I have the right to love and be loved in an unconditional manner.</p>
<p>Phosphenic Mixing creates a new neurological pathway; the message is imprinted in the brain and comes into action through the idea-motivity phenomenon. During the first session, the patient immediately feels confident as if he/she had had a ‟change of skin” or was ‟wearing new clothes”.</p>
<p>The patients can practice that exercise on their own, three times a day. Once in the morning, just after waking up, it is the auspicious moment for fixing or stimulating the message; once in the evening, before sleep, to message the brain what it needs to integrate during the period of regulation; and one more time during the day so that the message becomes unconscious and automatic.</p>
<p>Example: a student in psychiatry is anxious and fears that he is going to fail his exam in spite of the work he has generated to learn and revise his lessons. A single session of Phosphenic Mixing has given him ‟the bones of a good psychiatrist” who thoroughly knows the subjects he is dealing with. The self-confidence that he has developed has helped him successfully passing his exam.</p>
<p><strong>Practicing triangular or square breathing instantaneously reduces stress.</strong></p>
<p>In an airport, a woman who is waiting for her flight to take off is anxious. She is chain-smoking, walking relentlessly up and down the hall, asking ceaselessly and aggressively the airline employee for the time of departure as she is scared that she is going to miss the connecting flight. She then has coffee, sitting next to me, I suggest that she should practice a bit of triangular breathing to dissipate the stress she is accumulating. She does that and, one minute later, she feels calmer, friendlier. She thanks me and we exchange interesting conversations on other subjects.</p>
<p><strong>A child who is described as hyperactive at school.</strong></p>
<p>A mother asks me if I can give her some help treating her 8-year old son, described as an hyperactive by his teachers. He is always chatting with his schoolmates and cannot remain calm. He is restless.<br />I evaluate him as an intelligent boy, bright, spontaneous, a bit of a rebel.</p>
<p>Je commence à faire le phosphène avec lui et je lui demande de bien observer les formes et les couleurs des lumières qu’il voit se dérouler, les yeux bandés. Je lui demande de me faire une description à haute voix. L’exercice se fait en trois fois et dure une dizaine de minutes.</p>
<p>I start by doing a phosphene with him and I ask him to observe closely the shapes and the colors of the lights that follow one another, while he is wearing a sleep mask. I ask him to describe them in a loud voice. This is a powerful game of concentration as, during the entire exercise, he is fascinated by the dance of the colors and his whole body remains still. He enjoys this game of changing colors.<br />Afterwards, I ask him to repeat, in a loud voice, ‟I am calm and relaxed” while he is practicing Phosphenic Mixing with anteroposterior head sways.<br />At the start, he repeats that sentence in a loud voice for a minute, then he repeats it mentally ‟in his head” for another minute, then again in a loud voice for the third, final minute. The exercise lasts approximately ten minutes.</p>
<p>His mother is present during the session and she notices the instantaneous change in her son&#8217;s behavior. She purchases the Pocket Lamp so that her son can practice more exercises on his own.</p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong></p>
<p>A girl in the fourth grade cannot memorize certain mathematical laws and formulas. She gets it wrong every time. Her father, a financial director, does not manage to help her memorizing adequately.</p>
<p>I start by doing a phosphene with her and then ask her to observe closely the shapes and the colors of the patches of light that appear in her field of vision, while she is wearing a sleep mask. I ask her to describe them in a loud voice. The exercise is repeated three times for a total duration of approximately ten minutes.</p>
<p>Then, she writes down the formula clearly, in big letters on a sheet of paper. She recites it in a loud voice. She closes her eyes and tries to picture the written formula and repeats it in a loud voice.</p>
<p>First, she focuses on the lamp for thirty seconds and then closes her eyes while reciting and placing the formula in the phosphene.</p>
<p>Then, she focuses on the lamp for thirty seconds, then she reads the written formula in a loud voice, through the phosphene, using a second amp to dim its glow and be able to read through it.</p>
<p>The action of the phosphene increases concentration and clarifies memorization, making it sharper, more precise. Phosphenic Mixing creates a new neurological pathway to store the information.</p>
<p>She continues the exercise with the other formulas she needs to learn, following the same protocol. After the second week, her father compliments me because his daughter does not make mistakes on the mathematical laws any more and has good marks at school.</p>
<p>As for me, there is no doubt: Phosphenic Mixing is an efficient method of learning, it develops self-confidence, concentration, memorization, helps recovering regular sleep patterns and favors healing.</p>
<p>Every night, before I go to bed and every morning, when I wake up, I practice Phosphenic Mixing.<br />I feel calm and serene throughout the day. When I have to travel and suffer from jet lag, rhythmic breathing and head sways help me greatly to maintain a clear head and a high level of energy.</p>
<p>My daughter uses Phosphenic Mixing to improve her studying of foreign languages and other subjects. She is in the sixth grade and believes her good results are due to the practice of Phosphenic Mixing. My son is in the fifth grade and since he has been using Phosphenic Mixing, his grades have improved, in all the subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Educational protocol</strong></p>
<p>1- Observation of the phosphene with a description of the colors perceived<br />2- Exercise of Phosphenic Mixing with a positive sentence<br />3- Exercise of reading with the post-phosphene<br />4- Test of comprehension and memorization<br />5- ‟Star phosphene”: i.e. the patient focuses on the light bulb while moving their eyes up, down, left, right and following a diagonal that crosses the center<br />6- I give a glass of alkaline ionized water to the patient<br />7- I provide a lamp for practicing exercises at home</p>
<p>Conclusion: For my part, I practice everyday different breathing exercises, head sways and mental imagery. My children have started practicing and introduce the method of learning with the phosphenes to their circle of friends.<br />With my patients, I use phosphenes systematically and I provide them with lamps and some practical information, according to their situation.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Finding persons buried in rubble or missing after an earthquake, using divination.</p>
<p>I work in the humanitarian domain and, thanks to my function as the leader of a team specialized in the rescue of persons injured during disasters, I am often active in remote areas of the world, helping unprivileged populations. In order to provide you with a more precise idea of what I do, I am going to try to illustrate my situation by relating some of the things I experience during these interventions.</p>
<p>First of all, my participation in trying to find people buried alive under rubble is efficient only because I have had the opportunity, thanks to my many trips around the world, to receive many initiations, including Dr Lefebure&#8217;s. During that long quest, I encountered various techniques and teachings, I always made sure that I understood their practice through the basics that Dr Lefebure had taught me personally. That way, I have been able to avoid many pitfalls and dead ends…</p>
<p>A dog trained to search for survivors under rubble can only locate injured people for a short period of time, because their scent loses its sharpness very quickly. For my part, I can detect 10 times more persons.<br />In a word, I am able to detect physically, without using any aid like a pendulum or any other instrument used for divination, injured people buried underground, whatever the state of their wounds, by stretching my hands above the zones of rubble produced by the disaster.<br />I perceive everything through the chakras in the palm of my hands.</p>
<p>As a mark of recognition from the persons I save from certain death, I only accept a piece of fabric that they have owned. The quality and the cleanliness of the cloth or fabric does not matter.<br />Thanks to these ‟offerings”,<strong> I make a thick screen by sowing the pieces of fabric together. I then contemplate the sun through this patchwork, this cloth charged with ‟vibrations of pain”, during hours or sometimes days.</strong></p>
<p>In this ‟posture”, I try to immerse myself in these vibrations and channel the perceptions into my hands. As a complement,<strong> I do phosphenes with the reflection of the sun on water, and project the phosphenes on my hands. That is how my hands have become genuine tools of divination. I do not need a pendulum nor any other equipment, I use only my hands for divination.</strong></p>
<p>After an intervention, having faced extreme distress, it is absolutely necessary for me to evacuate the accumulated tension; that is why, after a field operation, I systematically enter retreat. I use my time in retreat to regenerate myself with the rhythmo-phosphenic techniques.</p>
<p>I would also like to highlight the fact that, since my early childhood, I have evolved in initiatory circles, and that allowed me to develop my latent psychic faculties at an early age. But, without the help I found in Phosphenism, i.e. without Dr Lefebure&#8217;s works, I would NEVER have reached my present level.</p></div>
