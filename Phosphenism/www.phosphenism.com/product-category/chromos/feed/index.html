										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ancients claimed that ‟light is the source of knowledge”. Thanks to Doctor LEFEBURE&#8217;s work, we can now understand why light is a veritable stimulant for the brain.<br />
Today, there are teachers in France who use the phosphenic method in their remedial classes, some do not hesitate to integrate it in all their classes. It is certain that if that kind of initiative was repeated a bit more often, there would be a ‟snowball” effect that would generalise the application of Phosphenism in every school, for the benefit of everyone. This book presents the basic principles and the first techniques of applications of Phosphenic Mixing so that the reader can verify for him/herself the truth of Dr LEFEBURE&#8217;s claims. Anyone who makes the effort of verifying these assertions will realize that this is not a tall tale and that this technique has the potential of making a profound change in education.</p>
