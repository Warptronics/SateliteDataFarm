					<description><![CDATA[<h3>It is a complete initiatory book intended for all, as the initiator wishes.</h3>
<p>In a few words, Doctor Francis LEFEBURE was initiated at the age of 18 by A. Galip through an imposition of hands which provoked esoteric clairvoyance in him. Galip himself was initiated into the caste of magi of the Temple of Zarathustra.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3>Visions and out-of-body experiences</h3>
<p>The meeting with a true Master is a significant event in a man's life, because it totally transforms his destiny. Francis Lefebure had the privilege of meeting one at the age of 18 who, through the transmission of rhythms accumulated over the centuries in Zoroastrian temples, triggered in him these strange and wonderful phenomena known as "out-of-body experiences".</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>INITIATORY EXPERIENCES Volume 2</h3>
<p>In his many other books, Doctor Lefebure described in details the initiatic principles and techniques he received and improved himself. In this book, it is his personal experiences that he shares with us in order to encourage all those who invest themselves in the path of spiritual development; thus strengthening their determination and their will to realize similar experiences.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>This book is the third course in "Phosphenic Yoga." For a good understanding, it is necessary to have previously studied "Phosphenic Mixing Applied to Education" and "Phosphenism and the Development of Clairvoyance" (Phosphenism and the Origin of Religions).<br />
Nevertheless, to allow the first reading of our present study on the relationship between dervish dances and phosphenes, we will draw a summary of the two abovementioned works.<br />
The phosphene is the multicolored spot that persists in darkness for three minutes after the fixation of a light source for about thirty seconds</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dances of WHIRLING DERVISHES are practiced in countries where the longevity is much higher than in the average population of the globe. One can explain it by the fact that the brain is bathed in cerebrospinal fluid that nourishes it. These body rotations around its vertical axis mobilize this liquid, thus causing a better nutrition and detoxification of the brain. That is why one notices a cerebral rejuvenation from the beginning of their practice (no risk of dizziness and nausea by the techniques we indicate). As a result of that action on the nervous system, some forms of rheumatism are cured, and some neurological diseases, even congenital ones, have been improves.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The mixing of ideas, brought about by the increase in the means of information and travel, brings together conceptions which, for centuries or millennia, were practically out of touch.<br />
In the consciousness of each one, conflicts and hesitations now occur because of this promiscuity of ideas of the most distant and diverse origins. Sometimes, the result is happy: the subject seeks in each current of ideas what it has of better and even, it endeavors to make a synthesis by means of a bond which appeared to him by this confrontation, bringing thus a new element to the human thought.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3>The sensory way</h3>
<p>Applying to the study of supranormal states, the physician's and scientist's approach, Dr. Lefebure, as a physiologist, analyzes the principles of initiation, particularly the reversal mechanism of sensory activities, thus unraveling the laws of spiritual perception.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>INITIATORY EXPERIENCES Volume 1</h3>
<p>Initiatic methods have always been taught empirically, without the candidate for initiation really knowing what is going on inside him. Moreover, the phenomena have usually been described in a poetic way, which does not make it possible to grasp the determining criteria of a successful initiation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3>Using the rhythm of 1/6th of a Second in Thoughts.</h3>
<p>Transmitting initiation from a distance is much easier than you could imagine. One of the foundations of this process is the use of a rhythm of 1/6th of a second in thoughts.</p>

<p>Fast mantras might be one of the greatest secrets of the Yogis. Nevertheless, none of them have been able to explain what their knowledge is based on. Many of them attribute importance to the ‟meaning” of the mantra and forget that the root of this word means ‟mental sound”.<br />
Rather than the meaning, it is the rhythm that is important, some rhythms triggering a real burst of phenomena in consciousness.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3>A new explanation of the origins of religion.</h3>
<p>Phosphenism was born at the dawn of humanity and has been used instinctively by all peoples at a certain stage of their evolution, by all forms of solar worship that associated prayer with focusing on the sun.<br />
This technique is still practiced by the Zoroastrians, whose priests are called ‟magus/magi (pl)”. Magic, in its original sense, is the lost science of phosphenes.<br />
Likewise, young shepherds often play with phosphenes and mix their prayers with them. And in effect, child shepherds are at the origin of all the major events of the Roman Catholic Church. This is also true for the religion of Mithra, in which the candidate for initiation had to observe phosphenes in a cave. There is also proof of the use of phosphenes by the Tibetans. In each temple, there was a book dedicated to the interpretation of the signs that could be seen when focusing on the sun. Phosphenism is thus a worldwide ideological revolution.</p>

<p>The third phase of the phosphene, the ‟diffuse glow”, is an energy emanating from the brain. It can be photographed and allows the perception of objects in complete darkness. This energy is the source of clairvoyance, premonitory dreams, visions, apparitions, and all supernatural manifestations.<br />
Moreover, this energy that is emitted by the brain accumulates in the places where people have practiced regularly with phosphenes, as well as in the ‟auras” of people who have practiced.</p>

<p>These phosphenic salts are what the Ancients called ‟egregor” and are at the origin of all the holy and sacred places, as they allow access to the subtle planes, to the invisible worlds. These phenomena are not as rare as one might believe, but a sort of law of silence has been imposed to avoid revealing ‟initiatory secrets” to everyone. Who could benefit from these phenomena and events? Who needs to hide their nature?<br />
Doctor LEFEBURE’s investigation sheds light on elements that nobody has previously analyzed.</p>
