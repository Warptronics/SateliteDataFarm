					<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The tests proposed in the FAQ section have the aim of teaching you how to let yourself be carried along by the sensations in order to amplify the phenomena and go from a purely mental exercise to the perception of subjective sensations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Too often, in effect, we see practitioners put techniques into practice without knowing what they canexpect in return, and evenworse, being unable to recognis the phenomena.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To avoid this stumbling block, these short tests, which do not constitute an end in themselves, allow one to become accustomed to being bathed by a veritable subjective universe which is surprising in its nuances and richness.</p>
