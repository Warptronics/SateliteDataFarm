The thousands of testimonies compiled on this website (see section: Testimonies) speak for themselves.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In any case, although they are right to keep a critical mind, the attitude of the rare detractors is often contemptuous towards the practitioners of Phosphenism. That is why it is not useful to try to answer them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Phosphenism is a doorway to the exploration of a subjective world. It does not pretend to analyze an objective reality in the manner of an exact science. However, this subjective world is part of reality, and everyone can experience it, for example through dreams.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It is undeniable that the theoretical foundations put forward by Dr Lefebure may be debatable. By the way, this principle is also valid for all hard sciences. It is nevertheless true that phosphenic techniques induce unforgettable subjective experiences in their practitioners, as many of them testify.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dr Lefebure&#8217;s empirical approach, which puts the emphasis on experimentation, is not dogmatic. So, to reject Phosphenism in its entirety is also to despise the words of those who have expressed themselves.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the detractors don&#8217;t take pride in devaluing the practitioners. And they are no more credible than someone who would say that dreams do not exist because nobody has been able to show one under a microscope.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There are opportunists. So, if in the course of your &#8220;browsing&#8221; on the web, you come across documents, informations, etc. on Phosphenism, remain very reserved and beware of putting into practice what is proposed to you. Almost all of these documents are misleading because, as with certain medicines, there are amalgams of techniques that it is better not to use.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The internet is also that: 90% of users who take their website, their blog, or the fora as therapy and who pour out their neurosis, their phobias or their paranoia at the image of our sick society.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It is therefore advisable to be careful and to respect 2 rules:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1 &#8211; To refer only to our official website.\u00a0<br \/>2 &#8211; To remain very careful and reserved as for the other writings, and to pay attention to the date of their publication because some are old and things can happen in 10 years.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Lefebure, by the very content of his works, has set the level quite high; what saves us from the vast majority of neurotics people who destroy the esoteric circles in which they participate.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>To all of you, thank you for your help and for your support.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_divider _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#24BABF&#8221; height=&#8221;1px&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_divider][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_font=&#8221;|600|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; background_color=&#8221;rgba(204,118,32,0.28)&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;6px|12px|9px|10px||&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Dr LEFEBURE School,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">the first<\/span> <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">teaching center for<\/span><\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:312}\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">\u00a0<\/span><br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>applied initiatic techniques.<\/b>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"TextRun SCXW38561520 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW38561520 BCX0\">Far from the stupid and debilitating sects, far from the pompous and secret societies, <\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW38561520 BCX0\">Phosphenism<\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW38561520 BCX0\"> imposes itself, more and more, as an alternative for all those who are in search of a true esoteric knowledge.<\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXW38561520 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"TextRun SCXW116225550 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW116225550 BCX0\">Today, <\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW116225550 BCX0\">Phosphenism<\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW116225550 BCX0\"> is practiced by hundreds of thousands of people in the whole world.<\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXW116225550 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"TextRun SCXW218546876 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW218546876 BCX0\">In <\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW218546876 BCX0\">Phosphenism<\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW218546876 BCX0\">, there is no guru to whom one must give allegiance, no dogma (one can be a believer or an atheist), no followers cut off from the world, but only individual practitioners perfectly integrated into society.
