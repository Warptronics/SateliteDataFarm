If you restrict yourself to a purely intellectual process, Phosphenism will be very difficult to understand as a majority of the phenomena baffle comprehension. If, on the other hand, you practice the techniques, intellectual understanding will come by itself through your personal experience. In effect, the intellectual aspects are freed of the principles that we habitually bind them in, and they benefit from the discoveries resulting from individual experience. <strong>In this domain, the only relevant approach is experimentation.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Phosphenism is a vast domain of research with several branches of study and application.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211;\u00a0The study of the effects of phosphenes on thoughts has led to two main applications:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Educational methods.<\/li>\n<li>The development of abilities of supranatural perception.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211;\u00a0Applied cerebral physiology has given rise to various techniques:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Cerebroscopy: the analysis of cerebral functions through the study of the alternation of double phosphenes.<\/li>\n<li>Alternophony: originates from the previous technique, it is mainly used for improving cerebral functions in the broad sense of the term.<\/li>\n<li>Gyrascopy: an ever-changing domain of study whose main characteristic is the development of a specific cerebral function: the rotational function of the brain, through the practice of gyroscopic meditation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each of the branches of Phosphenism has proved itself by bringing many solutions and leading to many discoveries (see personal <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.phosphenism.com\/index.php\/testimonies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">testimonies<\/a><\/u>). In the future, they will accompany every aspect of everyday life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, the study of Phosphenism sheds light on many mysteries: the origin of religions and the nature of initiatory techniques. Other aspects of the history of humanity have also become clear: what was hidden behind the scenes, in a certain way.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;2 &#8211; What is initiation?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several aspects of initiation. First, the word initiation comes from the Latin word <em lang=\"la\">initium<\/em> meaning \u201fbeginning, start\u201d. That shows that initiation is not a gift that enables people to enter the spiritual world in one go, as it is commonly believed. If you analyze all the traditions and religions, you will not find that concept anywhere.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Initiation is always the transmission of a non-corporeal energy. The person receiving that energy needs to maintain it with practice.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is that daily practice that will allow an individual to become aware of invisible energies and discover many subjective phenomena.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Access to that energy is always obtained by the use of phosphenes and the practice of rhythmic thinking (in the form of repeated prayers, mantras, litanies, or japas: constant prayers).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A characteristic of the phenomena thus produced is that these transmissions of psychic energy can be perfectly studied, reproduced, and verified<\/strong>. This is what makes the difference with the methods that claim to obtain physical phenomena (like telekinesis or levitation) and that still need to be proved (even spirituality has become materialistic!)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The concept is to stimulate cerebral activity in such a way as to produce synchronizations of the nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. That creates a very powerful energy which, when it is channeled in the thinking-processing zones of the brain, corresponds to the classical description of the awakening of Kundalini and consciousness extension phenomena. Authentic mystics and yogis always describe the phenomena they perceive as subjective. <strong>\u201fThe spiritual universe\u201d is touched by subjective perception.<\/strong> This is the area in which you should do your research. The subjective domain, in our materialistic and technological cultures, has still to be studied. <strong>Initiation, in the deepest sense of the term, belongs to the realm of cerebral physiology;<\/strong> this aspect had not been thoroughly explored before the works of Dr.\u00a0LEFEBURE.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alexandra David-Neel (who consulted Dr.\u00a0LEFEBURE as a physician), lived for a long time in Tibet and India. She stated that the most advanced lamas maintained that the \u201fphenomena\u201d belonged to the realm of the subjective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Footnote:<\/strong><em> Subjective experiences abide by certain laws, just as matter abides by its own rules. Many laws are common to the whole of mankind.

Thus, an Initiate can awaken deep rhythms in another person. If that second person maintains regular practice, beyond the manifestation of multiple subjective phenomena (visions, clairaudience, consciousness extension, out-of-body experience, astral projection, perception of chakras, awakening of Kundalini, etc.), he or she too will be able to transmit his or her rhythms. The Master or the Initiate does not need to speak to trigger this \u201ftransmutation\u201d of the individual. However, that does not mean exemption from elementary explanations or the comprehension of the initiatic processes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Footnote<\/strong>: <em>The state of absolute ecstasy that the dervishes reach is often felt by the onlookers.

There are only persons who, during their childhood, instinctively used phosphenes. They let their own cerebral rhythms carry them and it gave them access to various experiences. They do not understand the real cause of their capabilities. From that ignorance was born the myth of an \u201foccult science\u201d or \u201fsecret science\u201d that could only be disclosed to the individuals that are ready for it. If you study religious and initiatic traditions, you will find that they all use phosphenes and that the practice of focusing on direct or indirect sources of light has always been considered the highest teaching!

These phenomena are totally subjective that means that they take place in the domain of the mind and not in the domain of matter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"g\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nothing wrong can happen to the body and thus, there is no danger experiencing this inner cinema.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This justifies the name of out-of-body experience: consciousness of the body remains but at the same time situations that are not physical are perceived. Consciousness seems to be \u201fin two places at the same time\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is common to hear that out-of-body experiences happen only during sleep. That is the usual argument of those who do not know what they are talking about.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Very often, people confuse certain states of consciousness in dreams and out-of-body experiences.<\/strong> Sometimes you can be conscious within your dream, i.e. you know that you are asleep and you know that you are dreaming (that situation can lead to a directed dream). In that state, you only have to think about a situation to perceive it immediately. Many people confuse that state with out-of-body experiences. All they actually perceive is a reflection of the thoughts they have accumulated while they were awake. Often the scenes perceived are struggles with monsters, threatening chases, and dramatic situations. When questioning these persons, one quickly discovers that they live in \u201fliterature\u201d and cinematic ambiances that correspond to their conscious dreams. They are so permeated by those kinds of images that they impose themselves as soon as the consciousness leaves the way clear. It is then easy to believe one has had an out-of-body experience and fought against \u201fastral entities\u201d when one has only met one&#8217;s own demons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That concept is called \u201fconscious dream\u201d in psychology and \u201flow, mid, or high astral\u201d in esotericism. This classification of low, mid, or high astral is established about the level and quality of the conscious dream. In a simplified way we can call tormented dreams \u201flow\u201d; symbolic dreams \u201fmid\u201d and dreams with spiritual content (contact with a guide) \u201fhigh\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In those states, you face yourself and it is your own reflection that is perceived: a person thinking thoughts of sadness and depression will have distressful experiences. A mystical person thinks about God and will end up seeing angels. All that happens according to the laws of thought which are similar to the laws of matter, <strong>but reversed.<\/strong> On the physical level, two magnets of the same kind repulse each other. <strong>On the level of the mind, thoughts of similar nature attract each other.<\/strong> There is a polarity and an inertia in the thinking, the same way there is a polarity and an inertia in the matter. Their laws are similar but function in the opposite way. Thus, persons who live in unhealthy intellectual atmospheres will find the same ideas in their sleep, only amplified. Persons who live in spiritual atmospheres have more chances of making spiritual \u201fcontacts\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If people happen to find themselves conscious within a dream and believe that they are having an out-of-body experience or an \u201fastral projection\u201d. They will then tell everybody that out-of-body experiences and astral travels are dangerous, but they have not understood that out-of-body experiences or astral travels is something totally different from these conscious dreams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, dreams can have effects on the body (tetany, raise or diminution of blood flow in certain parts of the body, quickening of the heart&#8217;s rhythm). That is not the case with out-of-body experiences or astral travels. Certain types of \u201fdirected or conscious\u201d dreams can make people experience situations beyond time and outside of the body of such intensity that people will declare without hesitation that they have relived a \u201fprevious life\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;6 &#8211; Can you define more precisely out-of-body experiences and astral projection?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of the length of development needed to answer this question see \u201f<a href=\"https:\/\/www.phosphenism.com\/index.php\/project\/phosphenic-energy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Phosphenic Energy Universe<\/em><\/a>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;7 &#8211; Can Phosphenism be studied through parapsychology?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">NO, Phosphenism is an Initiatic, Esoteric, Spiritual type of teaching.

As an example, when we suffer a skin rash, the itching becomes unbearable. When we scratch, we feel a certain well-being. That phenomenon is called \u201fscratching ecstasy\u201d by physicians. Starting from a pathological state, one ends up in a state of ecstasy. This ecstasy is a sensorial dead end.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The process is the same with experiences. As an example, when a subject practices the initiatory exercises of head sways, he could make the mistake of swaying the head at too wide an angle, producing a massage of the sympathetic ganglions. A state of well-being will soon follow letting the subject believe he or she is enjoying a spiritual experience when he or she is actually experiencing a sensory phenomenon. It is not always easy to differentiate between real experiences and sensory stimulations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The famous metal-twisting experiments of Uri Geller are a physical phenomenon and can be easily explained by the physical properties of metals. The experiments of \u201fswitching on\u201d clocks and watches from a distance are well understood by physicists thanks to the crystallization properties of metals. Too many people let themselves be fooled because they have forgotten the basic notions of physics. Any metal tends to return to its original shape. That is why, in time, bridges can actually shorten or the spring of a watch can go back into tension. If one finds an old watch forgotten in a drawer, the mechanism can start to function again, thanks to the spring that has enough tension to make it work for at least 45\u00a0minutes. According to their academic level, some persons will see \u201fa psychic power miracle\u201d, others \u201fthe basic laws of physics\u201d in action!<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;8 &#8211; What is the difference between extrasensory perceptions and supranormal perceptions?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let us define those concepts precisely.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An extrasensory perception is a perception that \u201ftakes place without the involvement of the senses\u201d. It describes what is perceived without the participation of the physical senses. But without the senses perception is not possible. It is an absurd concept though certain persons try to \u201fsend thoughts\u201d to other people. That is irrelevant. If a person goes into a floatation tank, his or her physical senses are not stimulated. Nevertheless, that person still has many perceptions: colors, images, sounds, cenesthesic sensations, odors, etc. That would demonstrate the existence of perceptions existing without the participation of the physical senses. But in fact, these perceptions are not separated from the physical senses. An extrasensory perception would be \u201fa perception happening without the involvement of the brain\u201d, something that is not possible. On the contrary, the sensory deprivation experience underscores certain particular abilities of the brain, mainly a totally subjective sensory system that possesses the same characteristics as the physical perception system!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That notion is the opposite of the notion of extrasensory perception (perception without the use of the senses), and it is rather an inner sensory perception, taking place with the complete participation of the brain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is that form of perception that is qualified as \u201fsupranormal\u201d; it is established through the senses. Etymologically, supra means above, and beyond. The sensory deprivation experience in a floatation tank shows that a form of perception happens under the threshold of the physical senses, i.e. before physical stimulations reach a sufficient level to trigger a response of the physical senses. That perception is happening beyond the senses;\u00a0in an inner beyond. To be more precise we could create a neologism: perception under the threshold of normal perception.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(<em>Intra<\/em>: inside; <em>ab<\/em>: without; <em>infra<\/em>: under)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That perception belongs to the realm of the subjective. It is a form of perception that has the individual as the only witness, the same way that a person is the only witness of his or her dreams or thoughts. Nevertheless, subjective experiences abide by very precise laws, the same way the matter abides by its own rules. There are many constants shared by all individuals. It is a reality, irrelevant to the physical domain but in touch with it because of the role of the brain. The functions of the brain are made of chemical and electrical reactions that produce many exchanges of energy. Dr.\u00a0LEFEBURE discovered that, thanks to the light, these exchanges can be amplified. He also proved that the cerebral hemispheres do not function continuously as it is commonly believed (take a look at schools and how education is structured). Cerebral hemispheres operate by alternation and have many rhythmic functions. Thus, when cerebral rhythms are given a maximal amount of stimulation, subjective perception becomes as intense as physical perception. That amplification of subjective perception is supranormal perception and it is what, under different names, has been sought by all the saints and the mystics through appropriate training. It is that subjective universe that they called \u201fthe world of the spirit\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no contradiction between \u201fsubjective\u201d and \u201fobjective\u201d. This dichotomy does not demonstrate a physical reality as opposed to a non-existing spirit. \u201fObjective\u201d corresponds to physical perception; \u201fsubjective\u201d corresponds to \u201finner perception\u201d. Physical perception also contains a great deal of subjectivity, as in the end, it is the mind that analyses all perceptions. For example, if the same intensity of pain is applied to different people, it will trigger different intensities of perception of pain. When people verbally analyze their perceptions, that difference is even greater. For example, when people are asked to give their personal testimony on a particular event, it often seems they are not talking about the same event! On the other hand, if several people perceive the same subjective phenomenon it becomes an objective reality. Dreams are a very good example. For a long time, they have been considered strictly subjective perceptions. But in monitoring cerebral activity, scientists have found that dreams trigger electrical activity in the brain that can be measured objectively; objective and subjective are far from opposed, they are inextricably bound together.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thinking is the first subjective phenomenon that one is aware of, and gives access to a whole world of sensations. Thoughts can no longer be considered a consequence of cerebral activity because the brain is, amongst other things, the organ of subjective perception. In nature, an organ only develops in relation to an already existing energy, which is then perceived better and better according to the particular needs of the species or the individual. Eyes only developed because light existed beforehand. Hearing developed in order to perceive certain vibrations, bringing a better understanding of the environment. It is the same for all sensory organs. It is not because living beings started developing eyes that light suddenly came into existence! Thoughts function according to the same physiological processes, and cerebral activity allows the perception of energy that already exists. Thoughts are the threshold of the spirit.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;9 &#8211; What is the difference between the sciences of the psyche and initiatory techniques?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sciences of the psyche are still searching for a solid basis of understanding. The word \u201fscience\u201d can be confusing, as in the eyes of the general public it is too often the synonym for well-established and solid knowledge. Scientists know that this is not the case. Scientific theories are perpetually evolving, and that is a characteristic of the scientific approach. New discoveries are made at a faster rate today than in the past.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Very often, professionals of the sciences of the psyche imply that their knowledge of the mind is perfectly established and solid. Sadly, it is not the case. If you analyze those sciences, you will find that they are based on a great deal of theory and occasionally prejudices. In reality, what the different sciences of the psyche offer is nothing other than a grid of interpretation that attempts to decipher realities that unceasingly escape objectivity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Initiatic techniques are a sum of processes permitting one to obtain phenomena whose existence has been known for millennia. The fact that these phenomena have been observed does not imply that they have been understood and explained, but simply that particular circumstances produce certain experiences.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;10 &#8211; Do some mysterious phenomena belong to phosphenic phenomena?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the phases of the phosphene, the diffuse glow, possesses properties that define it as energy: it allows the perception of objects in full darkness and it is highly transmittable by telepathy. It can be photographed and it can be given a shape. The diffuse glow was called \u201fegregor\u201d in ancient times. The accumulation of phosphenic salts in a particular place gives rise to supernatural events, \u201fapparitions\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;11 &#8211; Are some aspects of Phosphenism part of the domain of the paranormal?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Phosphenism can explain a great number of so-called paranormal phenomena.

Though that dream appears perfectly trivial, its subjectivity led to an objective discovery.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most well-known subjective phenomenon is the dream. We are the only witnesses of the contents of our dreams and we can show no proof of what we perceive when we dream. But because everyone dreams, this subjective phenomenon enters the objective domain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If several people describe the same subjective phenomenon, it becomes objective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When a great number of people will have mystical experiences, these will enter the realm of the objective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, the \u201fworld of the spirit\u201d will always be made of subjective phenomena, unconnected to matter.

In the early phases of training, that energy will amplify all thoughts good or bad without distinction. That is why the practice of rhythmed thinking must always be associated with the practice of Phosphenic Mixing. It is also necessary to choose thoughts very carefully during rhythmed thinking sessions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A person suffering from depression should practice Phosphenic Mixing only. That is also true for persons with aggressive behavior. That phenomenon of amplification of negative thoughts is called a \u201fpurge\u201d.

Phosphenic telepathy consists of the transmission of rhythms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Phosphenic telepathy is the induction of a rhythm by reciprocity. Distance is an important factor, the closer the receiver is to the transmitter, the more intense the effects. This helps us understand the Fatima-style solar prodigies. That particular phenomenon was considered by the Catholic Church (after 13\u00a0years of canonic trials) as the \u201f<em>crown jewel of the Roman Church<\/em>\u201d but it was nothing more than a 100% phosphenic phenomenon. (If the sun had really acted the way it was described, we wouldn\u2019t be here to talk about it.) All the elements which led to the prodigy can be reproduced, but that does not make the event any less spiritual.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The meaning of the word prodigy is: \u201fsuspension of the laws of nature\u201d. What the crowd perceived on the plateau of Fatima is the solar co-phosphene which led to a sensation of the darkening of the sun. The other movements of the co-phosphene: sways, pulsations, and shaking are rhythms inherent to phosphenes and were interpreted by the crowd as the sun falling. Even the spectacular phenomenon of the grass drying rapidly, following a light rainfall, is a phosphenic phenomenon caused by the heat properties of the diffuse glow.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some witnesses felt a sensation of heat, and others a sensation of coolness. That is characteristic of a phosphenic experiment in which one projects the phosphene on the back of one&#8217;s hand. This experiment is all the more impressive when several persons project the phosphene towards the same person. The hand will start swaying spontaneously because of the rhythmic properties of the phosphenes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In these two experiences, some persons describe a sensation of slight heat; others will describe a sensation of coolness. In Fatima, the white balls of light that people perceived falling from the sky and unsuccessfully trying to catch while they vanished in their hands, were phenomena that are totally characteristic of phosphenes: the perception of subjective sensations of light. We know that while the retina is not stimulated by light, there is still the emanation of a subtle substance produced by the brain: the diffuse glow. This phase of the phosphene allows people to see objects in complete darkness, and it is during this phase and within that glow that mystics have visions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Footnote: <\/strong><em>In 1967, Dr. LEFEBURE sent letters and telegrams to the Vatican and Pope Paul\u00a0VI. He stated that a scientific explanation of the Fatima \u201fphenomena\u201d had been found. These revelations \u201fdisturbed\u201d the Pope and since, the Church gave up considering solar prodigies as the crown jewel of the Catholic Church. This is an implicit recognition of Dr.\u00a0LEFEBURE&#8217;s discoveries.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Another example of an effect of phosphenic telepathy: When you practice sways with the point of concentration, you obtain a certain quality of visualization.

The first aspect is the thought as such: Can someone enter the brain of another person and impose his or her will on that person? In this case, the answer is <strong>No.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nonetheless, many people believe this without having any proof.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second aspect is to analyze the question from the angle of a person who practices rhythmic thinking exercises. Rhythm introduces an element of structure in thought and gives it a superior hierarchical organization, and here the answer is different.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thinking is like chaotic masses of air: it uses a great deal of energy to produce a small effect. For example, the wind does not pass through walls. But if you induce a vibration or rhythm in the air it produces a sound that can easily pass through a wall. The difference is due to the rhythm of the energy. Similarly, when air masses are led into a rhythmic spiral movement, they acquire a formidable amount of power and can destroy entire cities: they become tornadoes and typhoons<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thought follows the same process. When it is rhythmic, it acquires an exceptional power that creates energy, elevating human capacities to a higher level. The rhythmed thinking produces the development of ideas, creativity, and intuition. Then, if it is given a spiral movement, its power becomes such that it triggers inner phenomena of great richness and depth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rhythmed thoughts, when projected on another person, will amplify that person&#8217;s <strong>own<\/strong> thoughts according to his or her capacity to receive. The transmitter and the receiver need to be as close together as possible because the quality of the result is in proportion to the distance separating them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Footnote:<\/strong> <em>Bewitchment or suggestion only functions on superstitious or easily influenced subjects.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;16 &#8211; What is bewitchment?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people think they have been bewitched when they are actually affected by a bacterial disease, mainly in certain regions of Africa where hygiene is lacking. Many of those diseases cannot be detected by analyses and the patients are then directed to consult a psychiatrist.

The tetanus toxin affects it, but does not harm the zones of judgment and intelligence.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The result is an atrocious impression, probably the worst one that results from that illness, that one\u2019s personality escapes control to become the prey of a mind-blowing, terrorizing power that invades one more and more. The faculty of judgment that has remained intact then concludes that the person is POSSESSED by a more powerful force that extends its hold, not only on the muscular system but also on the psyche.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the past, people did not understand that this possession was the action of minute doses of a poison secreted by tiny bacteria. The people around the subjects used to see them suddenly taken over by involuntary muscle spasms imitating voluntary motions and thought that the subjects were possessed by the devil. The subjects themselves, having the feeling that they were dominated by a force far superior to their own that had entered their body, could have been capable of accusing themselves of being possessed by a demon.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two points of view, bacterial and theological, are not necessarily contradictory: one can consider that bacteria are a physical manifestation of evil, first because they make people suffer. Then because they provoke troubles of the personality that make people act in an \u201fevil\u201d way. That is particularly true in the case of chronic tetanus which makes people irritable and violent as they need to relieve a sensation of muscular overexcitement. Moreover, by its action on certain zones of the brain, that toxin makes the subjects avoid other human beings and sink into daydreaming.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, bacteria are a primitive form of life, lacking intercellular organization and hierarchy within the same species. Metaphysically, bacteria represent the devil, i.e. a life form so ancient that for a long time it was the only one existing at the dawn of the biological evolution of our planet. We must put a distance between ourselves and that form of life. That is clear, for example, in the slowing down of intellectual life that is caused by illness. Plants, animals, and human beings especially show a high degree of intercellular organization and hierarchy in the different kinds of cells that compose them. The later a species appeared on the scale of evolution, the higher this degree is. This shows that organization, differentiation, and hierarchy follow the mysterious forces of nature that push us on the path of the future. Opposite to the devil-bacteria, the phosphene shows us the road to follow for perfecting ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;17 &#8211; Are there contraindications to the practice of Phosphenism?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as there are contraindications to certain pharmaceuticals (some medicines cannot be associated with other ones), there are contraindications to the practice of Phosphenism.

That causes a low level of calcium in the blood (alkalosis), and in sensitive subjects, it causes tetany in which the first symptom is a tickling of the fingers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In everyday life, one can observe that people with psychological problems do not breathe properly. Their breathing is limited to short inspirations and when they are surprised by a situation or shocked emotionally, they present shallow inspirations and block respiration. Thus, they provoke a repression.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In martial arts, one learns, on the contrary, to breathe out in order not to be subjected to a situation.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Rebirth and holotropic breathing<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rebirth and holotropic breathing are two methods of therapy. Both use the same form of breathing: hyperventilation. Hyperventilation is produced by a large movement of the thorax (completely filling the lungs), breathing out through the mouth. With expiration through the nose, it would take longer to empty the lungs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It takes a while before one can feel the effects that start with a tickling of the fingers, a precursory sign of the variation of the calcium level in the organism due to hyperventilation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At that point, the objective is to overcome one&#8217;s fear. One can be afraid of dying as the contractions can lead to a minor paralysis of the tongue and the uvula (a small pendant fleshy lobe at the back of the soft palate) because of the strong uncontrollable effects. That is one of the therapeutic effects: \u201fto go beyond conscious and unconscious fears\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the practice of rebirth, the subject maintains a breathing cycle and then, at the end of the session, verbalizes what has been happening. In the practice of holotropic breathing, breathing follows a piece of music in a music therapy style. At the end of the session, the subject verbalizes his or her impressions and draws a picture summing up what they have been through, often in the style of a mandala.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These breathing techniques take the subjects past their fears: unconscious (stress of birth) and conscious: fear of heights or speed\u2026 As these techniques untie psychological knots, the subjects feel better and relieved of stress after practice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many therapists use one of these methods as, if the procedure is followed correctly, results are produced quickly and systematically. For one therapy, about ten sessions have to be practiced. And these sessions last for one hour up to one hour and a half and are practiced in a group. So, these therapies are classified as short because of the small number of sessions necessary.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But the effects after practice sessions can have grave consequences on a psychological level if they are associated with rhythmic thinking which, as we have seen, is an amplifier of mental processes. These techniques are very unsettling.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Dr.\u00a0LEFEBURE&#8217;s breathing technique:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr.\u00a0LEFEBURE showed the importance of retention in yogic-mystical breathing (see <em>THE PNEUMOPHENE or the breathing techniques that open the door to the world beyond). <\/em>As he stated:<em> \u201fwhat is important is to create a thirst for air\u201d.<\/em> That thirst is created by retentions of various durations. The retentions between inhalations and exhalations created a square-shaped cycle.

Why pray? As a metaphor, one can compare the principle to a hydro-electrical plant. The energy produced is proportional to the height of the falling water. The higher it is, the more energy is produced by the plant.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prayer is admitting that there are forces higher than oneself. It means putting oneself in a position of humility, a state of receptivity. <strong>It is contrary to autosuggestion which is <\/strong>Self-affirmation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Autosuggestion makes an individual hyper-suggestible (as its name implies).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, and that is the most important, the state of hypnosis goes against all genuine yogic practices. Hypnosis only stimulates a very small number of neurons while initiatic techniques consist in creating many neurological connections to activate many cerebral functions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Be careful:<\/strong> a person associating Rebirth or Hypnosis with the practice of rhythmed thinking can end up being placed in a psychiatric hospital. It is important to know that. Some things should not be associated together.<\/p>\n<p id=\"Q17c\" class=\"g\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can Hypnosis lead to an out-of-body experience or to astral projection?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people seek out-of-body experiences without knowing what they really are or how to produce them. It is thus very difficult for them to recognize those phenomena. <strong>There is a strong opposition between initiatic experiences and psychological experiences.<\/strong> The latter do not belong to initiatic techniques which are a domain completely apart. It is extremely important to know which domain you are working on and what its limits are. It is also important to know what results you can expect from a particular technique and make the choice of these techniques yourself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The brain cannot do everything, and certain things are impossible. It is necessary, in practice or study, to define the field you are working on. Sadly, many people only start some research to validate the prejudiced ideas they have. And when they are confronted with a disturbing phenomenon that forces them to ask themselves questions, they react by denying the phenomenon, going so far as to say \u201fit is dangerous\u201d or that it frightens them. That danger, that fear, is only the risk of discovering oneself. Those people limit themselves to the production of superficial phenomena which are often purely psychological.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That kind of influence or attitude is more of a suggestion than a genuine catalyst of experiences. It is common to feel sensations that only touch the surface of the \u201fpsychological layers\u201d of the individual. It is common to experience sensations that touch only the surface of the \u201fpsychological layer\u201d of the individual and one often takes that for a goal that has been reached or a contact made with the deepest part of the self. Most of the time, those sensations are only a very pleasurable illusion. Images are perceived and a few pleasurable sensations are felt but it does not go any further than that stage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As an example, virtual reality helmets or funfair-style simulators create many sensations and \u201fexperiences\u201d. Depending on the images projected, you can have the sensation that your body is heavier or lighter, that you are falling or rising, or that you become smaller or very big. In the end, those are only sensory games, as the images stimulate certain sensory organs. They are not psychic phenomena. You are stuck in a sensory dead end and you wish the sensations would continue, as they are very pleasurable. It is the same process that happens when you feel an itch: you scratch and this scratching becomes a pleasure. You feel it is pleasurable to scratch. Physicians call that phenomenon \u201fscratching ecstasy\u201d. That too is a sensory dead end and creates a pathological state.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Initiatic phenomena rarely happen during a session, but usually several hours or a day after practice. One must not confuse sensory games, which trigger a short pleasurable moment, with initiatic techniques that lead to real experiences outside of the period of practice. Those experiences often occur during the night, sending consciousness into the \u201fcosmic planes\u201d (see \u201f<em>Phosphenic Energy Universe<\/em>\u201d). Initiatic phenomena are way beyond self-created sensations. Very few people accept to follow through with further study of these subconscious layers of the personality. On the contrary, those who do go further, discover a new aspect of themselves and the universe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Out-of-body experiences are not rare phenomena.

They miss the real phenomena as they are too subtle to be recognized. Experiences that could have been magnificent thus fail totally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To counter that lack of serious information, the School of Dr.\u00a0LEFEBURE offers technical files with studies of the different phenomena encountered in the practice of Phosphenism, opening up new horizons for students who wish to go further with their research and practical experiments<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study of Phosphenism enables one to understand the physiological sense of ancient concepts such as clairvoyance, chakras, kundalini, conscious dreaming, directed dreaming, consciousness extension, out-of-body experience, astral travel, etc. The phosphene amplifies subjective sensations; you will then discover that thoughts have their own behavior and that it is necessary to abide by their rules to develop the whole of cerebral abilities. Phosphenism puts into question prejudices and elementary or simplistic knowledge. It is a discipline in its own right, to which nothing needs to be added, as the fields of exploration and experimentation are immense, some still to be explored. Those persons who are more curious and motivated will have the possibility of investing themselves more fully in the different experiences and will perhaps discover, among other things, new areas of application.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;19 &#8211; Do drugs or psycho-active chemicals enhance the effects of Phosphenism?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certain drugs such as cannabis, magic mushrooms, ecstasy (a designer drug), or other psycho-active drugs can produce feelings of ecstasy or clairvoyance. But, when the hallucinogenic effects have disappeared, there is no enhanced perception left. Also, these effects can be classified as sensory games.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One person told us about his experience under the influence of L.S.D.\u00a025 (the strongest of all L.S.D.). During an experience with that drug, that man went through three different \u201ftrips\u201d as his intellect, mind, and body separated. His body lived an experience connected to dying: the sensation of living one&#8217;s own death and burial. His mind perceived more pleasurable phenomena: mainly moving lights with the feeling of a possibility of access to these lights, though no actual access was produced. We observe, in the case of this person, a complete disintegration of the personality with a mental block stopping the person from reaching the higher planes he perceived.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though in our opinion, it is not advisable to advertise hallucinogens even in an involuntary manner, it is impossible to evade the question as it is now often asked due to shamanistic practices and the attraction exercised by rave parties.<br \/>\nHallucinogens, mainly peyote, mescaline (an alkaloid of peyote), iboga (an African plant), and the infamous L.S.D. that is thousands of times stronger have gained a lot of attention recently from people&#8217;s interest in shamanism and rave parties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ravers, with their 120bpm techno music, which is composed of rhythms very similar to those found in certain initiatic ceremonies (with the electronics taken out) obtain only sensory amusements, certainly agreeable, but without any possibility of reaching phenomena that one could qualify as spiritual.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Phosphenism harmonizes and integrates a person with his or her surroundings. Drugs have the opposite effect, disintegrating the individual&#8217;s character and impairing his or her capacity to socialize.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reports by ethnologists show the ravaging effects of drugs on shamans when they recover from their trances. In the same way, a single glass of wine can annul all the benefits of a session of Phosphenism, hallucinogenic substances can only lead to a confusion of consciousness and, if repeated too often, to sensory dead ends.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;20 &#8211; Are there any therapeutic applications of Phosphenism?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the same way, sports have a beneficial effect on both the body and the mind, the practice of Phosphenism benefits the whole of a human being.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nevertheless, apart from the above-mentioned effects and the light therapy effects, no experiments have been carried out in medical circles.

All this affects thoughts. When a brain wave becomes gigantic, thoughts also follow the same pattern, creating images that are gigantic in both dimensions of time and space. For example, religions that use rhythmic thinking always produce images that are larger than life. <strong>In order to fully understand how to practice sways, see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.phosphenism.com\/method-individual-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;3 &#8211; Should I practice emptiness of mind exercises?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EMPTINESS OF MIND IS A CONCEPT EMPTY OF MEANING.<\/p>\n<p class=\"g\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The action of \u201femptiness of mind\u201d on thoughts.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When a subject tries to drive away every single thought, whether visual or auditive, the tension on the face is observed, as if blood flow were impaired.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After that exercise, fewer thoughts come to mind and it is difficult to resume reflection. Subjects also feel more nervous after that type of practice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People who practice those types of exercises for many years actually provoke a paralysis of their capacity for reflection and thus their sense of criticism. Many people experience very bad headaches and quickly find themselves subject to nervous disorders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The emptiness-of-mind exercises are often used by sects in order to weaken natural defenses. Those techniques are usually associated with a diet high in gluten, particularly in rice, which blocks the capillary vessels and impairs blood flow in the brain and thus prevents it from functioning correctly. A person who had practiced that technique for ten years became depressive and had suicidal tendencies. During the observation of double phosphenes, that person could only see one immobile phosphene on one side and nothing on the other side. That means that it was always the same brain hemisphere that was constantly under tension. That produced a nervous tension leading to depression and suicidal tendencies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a week of practicing lateral head sways, that person observed that his suicidal tendencies diminished, and he found the joy of life once again. Further observation of the alternation of double phosphenes revealed that improvement, as the person perceived two phosphenes alternating normally, proof that the connections between the hemispheres had been re-established.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Test:<\/strong><br \/>\nTry to keep the same thought in your mind (for example a flower).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will observe that thoughts are dynamic. They vanish or are replaced by interfering thoughts or are sometimes enriched by new elements.

Those nutrients influence our psychological state when we are awake, but also when we are sleeping.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the elements we \u201fswallow\u201d during the day will be transformed into proteins. The proteins will become \u201fprecursors\u201d, the neuromodulators or neurotransmitters which have the role of making our brain function.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our brain, several systems of neurotransmitters interact to modulate our behavior during the day, but also at night.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neuromodulators like dopamine and adrenaline correspond to the waking state, vigilance, and stimulation, while serotonin corresponds to the state of sleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nevertheless, we do not go from a state of wakefulness to sleep suddenly. On the contrary, it is during the entire cycle of wakefulness\/sleep that neuromodulators enter into play. We can say that it is during the day that we determine the quality of our sleep and in particular the aspects of light and heavy sleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As to the quality of our dreams: it is often determined by the last hour just before going to sleep. That is why a Phosphenic session in the evening will always yield more results than a session practiced at any other moment during the day, except for those persons who take care to fall asleep after an initiatory exercise or a prayer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certain \u201fprecursors\u201d I have just mentioned are \u201fessential\u201d amino acids. The term \u201fessential amino acids\u201d means that the organism cannot synthesize them. They are found in nutriments containing proteins. Tryptophan, for example, is the precursor of serotonin and facilitates sleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Essential amino acids compete with each other to pass through the haematomeningeal barrier and reach the brain. The most active amino acid will prevent the other ones from passing. Those struggles are quite complex and can explain certain difficulties encountered in falling asleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the evening, it is recommended to avoid the consumption of sugar, coffee, and certain teas or cola drinks. Red meat also should be avoided as it raises the tryptophan level which, as we have seen above, is a precursor of serotonin, the molecule of sleep. And as we need light sleep for provoking experiences during the night, it is preferable to facilitate the passage of other amino acids that lower the level of insulin secretion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A regular diet, eating at regular hours, and consuming the right quantities guarantee a good refreshing sleep which facilitates the production of experiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That balance will be obtained, not as one might think by cutting out the evening meal, but rather by eating a light meal composed of nutrients chosen according to the quality of sleep one wishes to obtain and also according to the quality of thoughts one seeks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lack of food in the evening would rather cause hypoglycemia and an agitated night.<br \/>\nThe expression \u201f<em>he who sleeps, dines<\/em>\u201d is false, at least in the usual interpretation. That expression comes from the Middle Ages, where one had the right to a bed in an inn only if one ate there. It would thus be more correct to say \u201f<em>he who dines, sleeps<\/em>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, the Venetian saying <em>\u201fhe who goes to bed without supper, will toss and turn all night<\/em>\u201d is full of wisdom.

Until today, the spiritual universe was considered strictly hypothetical because the tools used in scientific research, which are only extensions of physical perception, are not adapted to the detection of energies of a non-physical nature.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nevertheless, using a different process and other methods which are just as scientific, everyone can now discover this \u201fnew\u201d dimension possessed by all individuals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The phenic system, when stimulated, triggers the perception of spiritual planes that traditions call \u201fthe beyond\u201d, \u201finvisible worlds\u201d or \u201fsubtle planes\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The equivalent of the phosphene exists for all the other physical senses, to which one must add the sense of balance, the properties of the skeleton, muscular activity, breathing, and the perception of time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">THE VARIOUS PHENES:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Phosphene.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe phosphene (physiological rather than pathological) corresponds to the sense of sight.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Acouphene (the French word for tinnitus).<\/strong><br \/>\nThe acouphene (physiological rather than pathological) corresponds to the sense of hearing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Gustatophene.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe gustatophene corresponds to the sense of taste and the sensation of chewing.<br \/>\nIn monasteries, monks eat in silence while a brother reads a text. The host also produces excellent gustatophenes, its taste lasting for a long time.<br \/>\n(Recall the sensation of a taste and observe the evolution of your thoughts).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Pneumophene.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe pneumophene is connected to the act of breathing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Osteophene.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe osteophene is triggered by the vibration of the skeleton.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Myophene.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe myophene is connected to muscular activity, cenesthesic sensations, and sensations of movement. It is based on martial arts or practices such as tai chi chuan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>7. Gyrophene &#038; Equilibrophene.<\/strong><br \/>\nThese phenes correspond to the sense of balance, whose center is located in the inner ear. It is that phene that triggers the subjective sensation of moving or floating.<br \/>\nAn unusual perception of space: a sensation that the body extends beyond its normal spatial limits, with the impression of extending beyond the physical body that sometimes goes as far as the infinitely large or the infinitely small. There can also be a rhythmic pulsation of consciousness, oscillating between the infinitely big and the infinitely small, sways or the sensation of floating.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>8. Phene of the smell&#8217;s sense<\/strong>(olfactophene).<br \/>\nThis phene corresponds to the sense of smell.<br \/>\nIn places of worship and sacred places, incense is used to stimulate the phene of the sense of smell.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>9. Phene of the tuch&#8217;s sense<\/strong> (tactuphene).<br \/>\nThis phene corresponds to the sense of touch.<br \/>\nThe subjective sensation of a tactile perception, whose first manifestation is the perception of the double: the sensation of being contained within \u201fsomething\u201d which is impossible to touch physically, a sort of very pleasant wadded cocoon. Afterward, during out-of-body experiences, there is the perception of touching the ground one walks on, and the perception of objects that one touches. In that type of experience, one has veritable sensations of touch. There are also thermal sensations: coldness, heat or warmth, sensations of pressure or lightness, and sensation of void.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>10. Subjective sensation of time.<\/strong><br \/>\nCertain experiences make one lose the notion of time. Most often, they seem to last for a shorter time than they actually do. For example, a session of an hour and a half can be perceived as lasting three-quarters of an hour.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Occasionally, one can live through an experience that seems to last a rather long time, while in fact it only lasted several seconds in real-time. That occurs mainly during half-sleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All those phenes, and some potentially undetected ones (for example the phene of the voice which could correspond to auditory thought) are, of course, connected to one another. When one specific phene is stimulated, one can experience sensations connected to another phene.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, there is a third sensory system that has been called up to now \u201fpsychic centers\u201d or chakras. That system is connected to the phenic system. The third sensorial system corresponds to consciousness.

But these specificities go further. Phosphenes allow us to enter the deepest zones of the brain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The zone of vision is located in the back of the head, at the level of the occipital bump. <strong>The phosphene is perceived at the same time by the eye and by that zone that processes visual perceptions. The rhythmed behavior of the phosphene shows us how the brain really functions, and it is also possible to see what is happening in the interior of the zone where vision is processed.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cuneus is the organ that creates the images of a dream because, during sleep, there is no physical stimulation that involves the eyes. The cuneus is also at the origin of particular visual perceptions that are \u201fvisions\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the three concentric zones of the cuneus are stimulated using electrodes placed on the eardrums of a subject, in the first zone, the person perceives shapeless phosphenes. They correspond to what is seen in the visual chaos: imprecise nebulous masses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the second zone is stimulated, the subject perceives phosphenes with geometrical shapes. Similarly, if one focuses on the reflection of the sun on the water, one will quickly perceive triangular or diamond shapes. That shows that light spread in this second zone of vision.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the third zone of the cuneus is stimulated by electrodes, the subject perceives dream-like images but does not understand the relation to his or her psyche. That corresponds to the \u201fvisions\u201d that appear to people who experience the phenomena of clairvoyance. The works of Dr. LEFEBURE show that all the people who have developed the faculty of clairvoyance had the habit of observing and playing with phosphenes when they were children.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is therefore possible to develop the phenomena of intuition, clairvoyance, and visions by carefully observing the phosphene and practicing the observation of details situated within the phosphene.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8211; Focusing on a single detail within the phosphene.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Observe the nuances of color within the phosphene.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Observe the shapes within the phosphene<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Follow the movements perceived within the phosphene.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Search for details within the phosphene and observe your sensations, visual perceptions, and thoughts.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;9 &#8211; How can I direct or increase experiences?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.2&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principle: observe the details of visual, cenesthesic, or auditory sensations, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Points of reference and guidelines for directing experiences:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the beginning, the content of perceptions is not the most important. What is important is producing perceptions. The hardest part is to avoid trying to analyze the perceptions. There is a tendency to do that, as it is difficult to grasp all the elements that arrive because they are very incomplete or they are so rich that a good part escapes us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The references you should keep in mind in order to go as far as possible in the organization of perceptions are the following:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Observe the details of the sensations, whether visual, auditive, cenesthesic, or other.\u00a0<strong>Always focus on a detail of a sensation,<\/strong> in order to amplify that sensation.<\/li>\n<li>Observe the sensations of light or color.<\/li>\n<li>Focus on the images that belong to the world of plants and enter into these images: trees, flowers, or plants.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The most important point of reference: let yourself be carried along by the rhythms that you feel.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is not because there are no more sensations that the experiment is over. You must remember that the brain functions in a rhythmed manner. That is why the sensations can diminish or disappear for a moment. All that one needs to do is amplify the sensations: observe whether there is a feeling of rhythm or a movement, and focus on it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Example of an exercise:<br \/>\n<em>Work with another person as a team: the first person will trigger an out-of-body experience in the other, by projecting the energy he or she chooses. The observer (the person in the out-of-body state) describes the sensations and the perceptions that appear spontaneously.

Vague spots of colored lights float within it. That is what we call visual chaos. It is made up of spontaneous phosphenes produced by the activity of the brain: a visual perception of the exchanges between the hemispheres.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you observe the details of the visual chaos, you will notice that it becomes progressively more precise and brighter, and that colors start to appear along with increasingly numerous movements and shapes. After the densification of your visual chaos, you can easily perceive it with your eyes open. Some people believe that they are seeing \u201fauras\u201d but they are only describing the colors, movements, and rhythms of their own visual chaos. That perception of the various types of phosphenes and the experiences that stem from it are within the reach of everyone. In \u201f<em>Mystics and Magicians of Tibet<\/em>\u201d, Alexandra David-Neel describes the various forms of reclusion practiced by monks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"i\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>\u201fMeditating in the dark is a well-known practice in India and most Buddhist countries. The people of Burma build special rooms for that purpose &#8211; I saw different kinds during my stay in the Saghain mountains &#8211; but the monks only spend a few hours in them. In Tibet, on the contrary, some people stay in the dark for several years; some even bury themselves for life in those kinds of tombs\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is obvious that in these conditions of complete darkness, the lamas obtain an extremely rich and dense visual chaos. The impressive amount of time spent by the Tibetans on that focus shows how important the technique is to them. But, once you understand the physiological principles governing initiatory techniques, you realize that you do not need to practice such a strict asceticism. Visual chaos, after the phosphene, is one of the easiest forms of subtle energy to perceive and observe and leads to very interesting neurological phenomena. That technique is used in particular for developing phenomena of visions and clairvoyance, and for provoking the exteriorization of consciousness outside of the body.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That technique consists of observing the details of a totally subjective light. From a philosophical point of view, it is like seeking or going towards the light. That process belongs to all genuine initiatic traditions, and the practice of focusing on direct or indirect sources of light is universal.
