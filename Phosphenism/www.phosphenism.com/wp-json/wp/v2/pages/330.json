The second way to operate is more efficient but requires more training.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Phosphenes should be associated every day with your work, studies, or theme of meditation, in order to obtain concrete results in the development of your mental abilities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;2 &#8211; What are the impediments to the practice?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The only impediment is glaucoma, i.e. the hypertension of the eye fluids. Symptoms are sharp pains deep in the back of the eye.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is actually only a partial contraindication. Certain persons with a slight case of glaucoma practiced with phosphenes against our advice, taking a few elementary precautions. They used a weaker (40\u00a0watts) light bulb, sat further away from the lamp, and focused on it for shorter periods. Their glaucoma did not worsen and their eyes actually became more resistant. These persons managed to progressively get closer to the lamp and could use slightly more powerful light bulbs without discomfort or eyestrain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Persons that were very sensitive to bright lights also noticed that after regular practice with phosphenes, their eyes adapted better to bright environments. After a few months, they found that the use of sunglasses was not necessary anymore.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a surgical eye operation (for example, for a cataract or a retina&#8217;s detachment), one should wait for one to two years to resume practice. After a laser operation, one should wait from 6\u00a0months to a year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The effects on eyesight are very positive, provided the conditions of use are respected; these norms have been established through more than 35\u00a0years of experimentation on thousands of cases. Moreover, some methods of visual physiotherapy, like the Bates method, use light to re-educate the eyes. If done safely, the practice of short periods of focusing on sources of light is an excellent exercise for the eyes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"g\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Do not get be alarmed if, in the beginning, you experience a few problems of adaptation like watering of the eyes or slight headaches.

The globe hardens while the field of vision shrinks progressively. Glaucoma can lead to blindness through the destruction of the optical nerve because of an excessive eye tension. Chronic glaucoma is actually the main cause of blindness. In France, an estimated number of 500,000\u00a0people suffer from this affliction<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, older persons should get their eyes examined. Certain categories of persons should be even more careful: persons affected by diabetes, myopia, artery hypertension and other blood vessel illnesses, and persons with a family history of glaucoma.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the case of glaucoma, it is necessary to follow a treatment designed to lower ocular tension.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Persons affected by a strong case of glaucoma should not practice the use of phosphenes. Nevertheless, they can practice with the other elements of the phenic system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Phosphenic practice is open to anyone without major eye problems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For more information see: <em>Phosphenic Mixing applied to Education<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If in doubt, you should get advice from your ophthalmologist.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Footnote\u00a01:<\/u><\/strong> The word phosphene has several meanings. And it is mainly found in medical vocabulary. As for the french word \u201f<em lang=\"fr\">acouphene<\/em>\u201d (which means tinnitus, in English), it is another term used by Phosphenism. Without going too much into details, beginners have to know that phosphenes and acouphenes we use are only <strong>physiological<\/strong> ones, as opposed to pathological ones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u>Footnote\u00a02:<\/u><\/strong> We strongly advise those interested in practicing Phosphenism <strong>not to drink any alcoholic beverages at all during training periods<\/strong>. A single glass of wine slows down brain reactions for several hours, according to Paul Perrin, professor at the Nantes School of Medicine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;3 &#8211; Do myopia, hypermetropia, or astigmatism hamper the practice of Phosphenism?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No, because the quantity of light received is still the same and it is that energy that matters for phosphenic mixing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Through the intense exercise of the iris caused by the alternation of strong light and darkness, phosphenic practice <strong>improves<\/strong> certain conditions of the eye such as synechia (the sticking of the iris to the crystalline lens). Nearsighted persons will notice a significant improvement in sharpness.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The regular practice of Phosphenism improves visual sharpness by one dioptre after the first month whatever the nature of the initial deficiency.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Persons wearing corrective glasses will quickly notice an improvement in their visual sharpness which could lead to them not needing correction anymore.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. LEFEBURE is a good example of the positive effects that phosphenic practice has on the eyesight. A short time before his death, at the age of 72, he could read texts at a normal distance without glasses during lectures. That is quite remarkable as it has been proved that presbyopia starts affecting people after 50\u00a0years of age. That demonstrates the positive effect of the phosphenes on eyesight. Moreover, the majority of older phosphenists do not wear glasses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;4 &#8211; What disorders of the eye are not improved by practicing Phosphenism?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Cataract<\/em>:<\/strong> as far as we know, practicing Phosphenism has no effect, positive or negative, on the advanced stages of cataract. Cataract hampers practice significantly as the retina does not receive the right amount of light. And the blood flow stimulation caused by the alternation of bright lights and darkness may have a positive effect on the early stages of cataract. We have not experimented on this subject.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>The floating bodies of the aqueous humor of the eye<\/em><\/strong> (the soft jelly which forms the main part of the eye behind the crystalline lens): generally, these floating bodies are transparent enough not to get in the way of a strong source of light. Though bright light will improve vision in these cases, it does not have a positive or negative effect on the floating bodies of the aqueous humor of the eye. It is interesting to notice that after 50 years of age, fragments of the embryo vessels of the retina start entering the aqueous humor. The border between normal and pathological is vague.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Conjunctivitis<\/em>:<\/strong> according to the eye doctors we contacted, the lights we use cannot worsen conjunctivitis let alone cause it. In cases of trachoma (an infectious chronic conjunctivitis of African origin), eyes redden during the experiment. This sign can help to detect the infection in persons unaware of it. That congestion of the conjunctiva does not influence the development of the infection.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Dychromatopsia<\/em><\/strong> (color perception disorders): the most well-known color perception disorder is true color blindness (confusion between red and green). It is obviously difficult to ask color-blind persons about the color they perceive in the phosphene as the words we use have a different meaning to them. We encountered the case of a color-blind person (diagnosed twice, once when drafted into the army, the second time in a job examination) who told us that within the phosphene, colors appeared brighter and better differentiated than usual.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;5 &#8211; I did phosphenes, my eyes feel itchy and the conjunctiva reddens.&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]The reddening is caused by the vasodilation of the conjunctiva.

It is corroborated by the number of people satisfied with the results of their Phosphenism practice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thousands of people have practiced the method for the past 40\u00a0years. If it created any trouble, we certainly would have had to restrict diffusion to the Esoteric circle of people, whose thirst for knowledge takes them beyond such annoyances.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;7 &#8211; What can be done in case of difficulties in getting used to focusing on the lamp?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sit further away from the lamp, beyond the 1.50\u00a0meters (5\u00a0feet) recommended by Dr. LEFEBURE. Tilt the lamp slightly towards the ground.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, for persons with extreme sensitivity to light, put a white cloth in front of the lamp until your eyes get stronger through training. You can also use a weaker light bulb (60\u00a0watts, for example), sit further away from the lamp, or focus on it for shorter periods.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also possible to use a natural light bulb (ref: A08).

But as soon as you want to switch to sustained practice, it is better to use specialized equipment. Thus, not only will the phosphene be more exploitable, but you will also avoid any eyestrain, even during long periods of practice, like students in pre-exam periods who do a great number of phosphenes over periods of 8 to 9\u00a0hours.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certain architect lamps can also be used but, in this case, you should use the phosphenic light bulb (ref: A08), a photo-enlarging type, which can be purchased from a specialized photography shop or directly from the Phosphenism Publishing. This type of bulb emits light in a perfectly homogeneous way, and produces a very bright phosphene.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;9 &#8211; Is it useful to switch to a more powerful light source?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.0&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For educational purposes, no. The norms established by D. LEFEBURE after more than 35\u00a0years of experiments show that a 75-watt bulb is perfectly adequate to trigger the needed neurological reactions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That type of light is too weak to harm the eye if it is used at a distance of at least 1.50\u00a0meters (5\u00a0feet). At that distance, no heat diffusion can bother the eyes. The dazzling brightness of car headlights is a lot more harmful than the light generated by the Phosphenic Lamp.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We know several persons in the show business, mainly actors, who testified that they used cinema or theatre lights to create phosphenes without any discomfort.

Because of that feeling of obviousness specific to Phosphenism, which hides the causes, the results will usually be noticed by the people around you rather than by yourself.

The word \u201fphene\u201d was created in 1834 in the vocabulary of chemistry, to name the nucleus of benzene. The same root is used to name its derivatives, \u201fphenol\u201d being the most important one. It was named that way because it also shines.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 1838, the same root was used again. The word \u201fphosphene\u201d was used by two research scientists in two different fields. The naturalist Lelorgne de Savigny (1777\/1851) used it to name a species of the glow-worm, and the physiologist Venzac used it to name spontaneous perceptions of light.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">D. LEFEBURE created the word \u201fPhosphenism\u00ae\u201d from the word phosphene which, in grammar, is called a restrictive neologism. The main root of the word phosphene means light and recalls Phoebus, the Sun. The word \u201fPhosphenism\u201d is more euphonic for designating the whole of the phosphenic techniques. Moreover, we use the term \u201fmental images\u201d to avoid confusion between the notions of \u201fmental images\u201d and \u201fimages of retinal persistence\u201d. It is the latter that we call \u201fphosphenes\u201d. This terminology is important because, in ancient texts, the description of phosphenes can be found, but the authors lacked the terms to describe and name these subjective perceptions and frequently used the words \u201fcolors\u201d or \u201flight\u201d, causing their work to be impossible to understand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, in an extract of \u201f<em>Parva Naturalia<\/em>\u201d, Aristotle describes the phosphene by contiguity of colors and solar post-phosphenes:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201f(\u2026) <em>the feeling is not only within the sensory organs but also in the organs that have ceased feeling.

For example, when we go from sunlight to darkness: sometimes we do not see anything, because the movement created in the eyes by the ligh remains. And if we look for a long time at a single color, whether white or yellow, it appears again, where we shift our glance. And if we blink while gazing at the sun or another shiny object, for those who observed it along a straight line &#8211; It is along this line that the vision will exercise itself &#8211; it appears first as the color it is, then it becomes red, then purple until it turns to the color black and disappears.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ARISTOTLE, <em>\u201fShort Essays on Natural History\u201d,<\/em> Publisher \u201f<span lang=\"fr\">Les Belles Lettres<\/span>\u201d, Paris, 1965, page\u00a080<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=&#8221;29 &#8211; My eyesight does not allow me to do phosphenes, what can I do?&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.0&#8243; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; open=&#8221;off&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have no pathological acouphenes (the French word for tinnitus), you can work with the equivalent of the phosphene on an auditive level, in other words, with physiological acouphenes.

For this reason, to respond to the specific needs of those who practice Phosphenism, we have created a special bulb that meets the double characteristics of daylight and natural light. Two properties united together in a single bulb.<br \/>\nThis bulb is distributed only by Phosphenism Publishers (<span lang=\"fr\">Les Editions Phosph\u00e9nisme<\/span>).<br \/>\nIf your financial means do not permit you to purchase of this type of bulb or if it is just to give you an idea of the practice, you can use a white bulb in which you cannot see the filament and that does not have a brand marked on the top.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">[\/et_pb_accordion_item][\/et_pb_accordion][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;1_3,1_3,1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_button button_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.phosphenism.com\/faq-phosphenism-development\/&#8221; button_text=&#8221;Next FAQ&#8221; button_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; admin_label=&#8221;Bouton&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; custom_button=&#8221;on&#8221; button_text_size=&#8221;20px&#8221; button_border_width=&#8221;2px&#8221; button_border_radius=&#8221;2px&#8221; button_icon=&#8221;&#x35;||divi||400&#8243; button_letter_spacing_hover=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; button_text_size__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_one_text_size__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_two_text_size__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_text_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_one_text_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_two_text_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_border_width__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_one_border_width__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_two_border_width__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_border_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_one_border_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_two_border_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_border_radius__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_one_border_radius__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_two_border_radius__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_letter_spacing__hover_enabled=&#8221;on&#8221; button_letter_spacing__hover=&#8221;0&#8243; button_one_letter_spacing__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_two_letter_spacing__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_bg_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_one_bg_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221; button_two_bg_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;off&#8221;][\/et_pb_button][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><div class='et-box et-info'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class='et-box-content'>If you cannot find the answer to your question here, you can post it in our forum (only accessible to our students); a phosphenist may be able to answer it.
