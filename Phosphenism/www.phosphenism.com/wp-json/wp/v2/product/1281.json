Attention is sustained without effort; intellectual work is more organized and of better quality. For this reason, the device is used very often by students in preparing for their exams. Subjects of study, even the most difficult ones, become more attractive during alternating hearing. One develops a greater motivation for studies.<br \/>\nPsychic development: Likewise, associating the Alternophone with initiatory techniques makes them more efficient. Many psychic phenomena are thus experienced, as well as states of relaxation and calm of mind.
