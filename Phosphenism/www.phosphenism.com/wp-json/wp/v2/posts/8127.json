I have had extraordinary experiences which have led to exceptional spiritual achievements. This new initiatory process has revolutionized my life. My congratulations and thanks to Daniel, Alain and the whole team for having used very sophisticated means to make Phosphenism accessible to all.<br \/>\nI experienced indescribable sensations while practicing the ring of light exercises.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Yvena G.

I once had a dream about a worry I had after a law exam. The professor had changed the examination mode, which initially had to be in the form of questions and answers. He told us so. But at the last minute, he put in a practical case.<br \/>\nI wasn&#8217;t overly keen on this exam and thought I got just the average or a little lower. Worried, I went to sleep.<br \/>\nAnd I dreamed that I had a 12 and that the secretary of my school gave me the note on paper, when that was not possible, since everything was usually sent by email.<br \/>\nIsn&#8217;t it that she was late in sending the grades to the students by email? And the delegates asked him to print them out for us on paper. What she did, but wanted to give them herself .<br \/>\nI had previously told two of my comrades that I had a 12 and had dreamed of it.<br \/>\nAnd so everything that happened in my dream happened. The comrades were surprised, telling me \u201cI don&#8217;t know how you do it\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Rudy R.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>The practice of Phosphenism has brought me many experiences which have a positive impact in my everyday life. I feel more free and available, a great ease in all my activities. The advice that I sometimes receive at night allows me to anticipate certain situations.

Every day I understand a lot of things better and better. I have answers to my existential questions. Why am I like this or that? Why such an event happened to me\u2026 So I live this experience of knowing myself more and more every day. Rhythm-phosphenic exercises put my head in order.

We now have at our disposal a remarkable work of research, analysis, synthesis and restitution carried out by Daniel. He does not hide anything, on the contrary, he gives all the keys to both individual and initiatory development. I do not think that there is currently on Earth something equivalent and so successful available to everyone.<br \/>\nPersonally, I printed the texts provided with the videos. I read, I reread, I reread again. A simple reading cannot be enough.<br \/>\nI watch the videos, I listen to the recordings I made on repeat.<br \/>\nAnd believe me, it takes all of this to manage to assimilate, to integrate everything that Daniel puts at our disposal.

In this vision I was a spectator of the events I had previously experienced and I heard a voice close to my right ear explaining to me why I had made the right decisions. Then the voice cleaned my writing of the traumas I had experienced and gave me something like new, as if the hard drive in my brain had been repaired. Upon awakening, I felt a deep well-being that I now feel every time I practice the ring of light. It is an appointment that I would not miss for the world.

At the start from a few e-books.

For months I read the pdf , the forum etc and one day I decided that this was really my way, so I bought the lessons and the lamp. I went all out for several months (3-4 hrs \/ day).<br \/>\nIt allowed me to quit smoking without any effort and to quit alcohol and this only 10 days later !!!<br \/>\nAnd then came the flashes, dreams, teleportations etc\u2026.<br \/>\nThe discovery of Phosphenism also changed my life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Marie B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I got to know Phosphenism in 2006 quite by chance while doing research on the net initially out of simple curiosity but I quickly understood the importance of the work of Doctor Lefebure\u2026 I got all the available books as well as an Alternophone , a Mantratron and the phosphene lamp\u2026 and at work !! In 2007 I did an internship at the school of Dr Lefebure (30 Gard) and I have very good memories of it\u2026 All this approach allowed me to have exciting experiences, duplications, daydreams and very beautiful travels through the Universe\u2026 Phosphenism has also allowed me to keep my balance and a good level of energy despite an upset family situation and the procession of worries that this generates.

Mr. Stiennon&#8217;s videos are very well done and the exercises easy to practice in real time.<br \/>\nBy watching the videos and doing the exercises as explained, I was able to correct any errors I had introduced in the swinging, breathing or static tension exercises. After having &#8221; reframed &#8221; myself , thanks to the videos I obtained very beautiful experiences as much in the waking state, as the possibility of acting on my environment, which had the direct consequence of improving the quality of my life, that night plunging me into a fairyland of impressive experiences.<br \/>\nThe day of meetings in which I was able to participate will remain etched in my memory for a long time. The meeting point took place at a practitioner&#8217;s home who brought us to truly &#8221; magical &#8221; places. It is therefore in a particularly friendly atmosphere that we were able to work on certain very specific exercises under the direction of Mr. Stiennon , who for the occasion had traveled with his wife in his small caravan.<br \/>\nI have participated in many courses and training before, but I have never seen training of this quality. Quality also at the level of all the participants in this day, where beginners were not admitted, which allowed us to enter very quickly into experiences of a very high level.

The only thing I regret is not having started the training earlier.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Christian G.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>There are many wonderful experiences, but at the same time, I feel like I am only at the beginning of this spiritual path. Of course I have to practice more and more. The light is a real ladder that can lead to the Divine Creator, it reveals for me the secrets of my birth &#8211; as a human creature &#8211; and at the same time the secrets of the Universal Creation.<br \/>\nIn summary, the practice of the first level of training led me to :<br \/>\ngood mental focus,<br \/>\nbetter visual acuity (of the eyes) than before,<br \/>\nextrasensory perceptions,<br \/>\nthe feeling that I have also lived other previous lives,<br \/>\nsome small signs of telepathy with some friends,<br \/>\na fine intuition of certain future events,<br \/>\nI had some very beautiful lucid dreams.<br \/>\nWhen I see the physical light, I sometimes have the impression of being at the foot of a mysterious coronation that amazes me and amazes me at the same time. Thank you a lot.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Lacramoniora V. (Romania)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Although my schedule is busy, I have this growing desire to continue the initiation with a big thank you for your dedication Mr. Stiennon.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Veronique G.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>When I do my exercises, I don&#8217;t want to stop because I have a feeling of ecstasy, I feel as if I was transported somewhere especially when I do small swings. Frankly these are a great experience for me and my entourage because everyone benefits, I give you an example: the dismissal of my companion was easy to overcome. Thank you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Claire T.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I have several dreams every night, some carry a message for me or respond in a colorful way to a questioning formulated the night before. Overall my dreams are rich and varied. I would like to thank Daniel Stiennon as well as Dr Lefebure for having me accompanied in the occurrence of this great change in my life because Phosphenism has certainly contributed to perfecting the personal work undertaken.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Benedicte G.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_divider color=&#8221;#800000&#8243;
