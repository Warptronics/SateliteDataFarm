I am fairer, calmer, more tolerant, more positive, I feel wise. I was already a bit like that before, but now I feel deeply beautiful (I&#8217;m not talking about the physical though &#8230;)<br \/>\nPeople say that I am a sun, a rainbow and that makes me smile, because that means that I radiate what I feel inside me and that is why they all come to pump my energy. I protect myself, but I gladly share this inner happiness; it is as if everything was beautiful\u2026. At the work level, I am very efficient &#8230; what happiness!<br \/>\nThank you very much for all of this and for all the work you do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Fran\u00e7oise D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Thank you for your dedication which goes straight to my heart.

I am sure there is no equivalent. I talk about it knowingly, because now at 65 I do not count the number of movements, obediences and lodges that I have been able to attend without removing even a quarter of what you have brought me, because my path of life is the initiatory path\u2026 Your training is so complete that you just have to take the trouble to follow it. And as you rightly say, why play parrots when everything is much better explained in your training cycle. Answering a question is a bit like reading only the back cover of a book, when it is much more exciting to read the book. Your class on the Cave of Knowledge and the Power of Reverse Thinking has been a real eye opener for me. (&#8230;) With all my gratitude.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Patrick C.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>The teaching on the 4th light is particularly interesting and I would like to praise the educational effort accomplished.

During experiments, I have the distinct sensation of flying over the room or the place I am thinking of. I just have to think of a place to get there directly in a fraction of a second. The distinct sensation of doing the exercises and of flying over other places just by thought. The feeling of flying is very pleasant and the fact to see the closed eyes is just magic. What more can I say, thank you and let there be Light !<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Paolina P. F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Since practicing the exercises, I feel better, as if at peace.<br \/>\nI feel that my brain is more fluid, my ideas clearer, and also some perceptions of flashes of light during the day, and dreams more clear and precise.<br \/>\nAnd also the perception of feeling and seeing the energy of people and objects at certain times.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Thierry B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I am Dieudonn\u00e9 living in Kribi one of the seaside towns of Cameroon.<br \/>\nI have been drawn to spirituality from a young age. I discovered Phosphenism via Google about 9 months ago.<br \/>\nI have been initiated into the African Tradition since 1996 at the request of my clan as part of the preservation of the latter&#8217;s values. In my ongoing quest, I bought a Practical Guide to Spiritual Awakening which talked about phosphenes. Ignoring what was called phosphene, I had to resort to Google. This discovery of Phosphenism is for me a sign of destiny.<br \/>\nI am very happy to belong to this formation in the hope that the Phosphenism courses will allow me to ensure a clear and non-empirical transmission of the tradition to posterity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Dieudonne B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>This morning, up at 4 o&#8217;clock as often happens, here I am wanting to do phosphenes by myself and without video lessons.<br \/>\nLooking at the light and praying to the Divine, here I am feeling a natural movement that leads the light energy throughout my body. The feeling was strong especially in my organs. My request then was the healing of my whole being.<br \/>\nThen after about half an hour of practice, I started to cry thinking about the Love that was coming to me for my whole family.<br \/>\nIt is a real happiness to witness an emotional healing and to realize the action of the Divine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Dominique R.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I have had many experiences:<br \/>\n1 &#8211; First of all, on the fact of remembering the inter-hemisphere rhythm, anticipations of events occur at almost a second during the day, for example, it suffices that a person approaches without my being able to see him with my physical eyes, and I see him mentally in image as he is with great precision. So even though a person is behind me, I perceive his face in my mind.<br \/>\n2 &#8211; In terms of sleep, I can very quickly decide what time I want to wake up the next morning and indeed, I wake up not only at the exact time, but also to the nearest minute, this phenomenon occurs. is accentuated with the advance in practices.<br \/>\n3 &#8211; At the level of dreams, they are intense, they seem more real than the reality of the day, and generate real happiness, I have the impression of learning more in my dreams than in the experiences lived during the day.<br \/>\n4 &#8211; At the telepathic level, I sometimes anticipate what a person will say just by observing him, and if he talks to me about a particular person, I am able to perceive him mentally and him describe who she is talking about without even knowing her; it is quite impressive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Damien C.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I tried to send phosphenes to my hands and was greatly surprised at the heat I got.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Madeleine M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I am surprised by the quality of the explanations and the exercises.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Alain P.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Thank you for all this realistic information, because for my part I feel myself trudging between contradictory elements that I attribute to age &#8230; and yet a certain internal force, whatever it is, is there, and I know that it is coming of your teaching.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Dominique S.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>The training that I receive through Phosphenism has elevated my being towards another dimension which is certainly placed at the level of daily realities, but also and above all at the level of the height of the soul. I thank Dr Lefebure for all his inspiration and especially Daniel Stiennon for the continuation of his work. The formation is perfectly clear despite the distances; I live in Tanzania.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>William M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Very good training, very complete which requires a real commitment. It is a unique and complete training without equivalent in my knowledge.

Since 2015 that I am interested in this route, I learn at my own pace and discover pleasant sensations during the day (or during dreams) brought by these exercises. I know deep down that I must continue on this path. I had a dream where the first and last name of Daniel appeared to me, my subconscious gives me the clue to continue and to go further; I feel fascinated by esotericism. In type of experience, I want to reconnect with my FRIEND, achieve what I came to do here, come to a state of enlightenment while remaining in balance, in order to become the best version of myself and subsequently impart this knowledge for the benefit of others; to come out of the illusory matrix. I want to go further and continue this teaching.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Mickael C.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I am happy to have taken part in this training. The acquisition of phosphenic lamps allowed me to really practice the exercises. These brought me a lot in my initiatory journey. They developed visualization skills in me. I regularly reactivate the point of concentration as part of my teaching profession. The phosphene mixed with a vortex and mandala image allows me to concentrate, but also to chase away my negative thoughts as if it acts like a black hole.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>David L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>My experience with the ring of light leaves me speechless. When I started with Phosphenism, I admit that my financial situation was not pleasant. I was still anxious as the monthly deadlines approached. But since I have been using the light-sided thoughts in relation to money, my life has changed. All these synchronicities that I have been going through for two months come from a simple coincidence. This is proof that the power of the Ring of Light is a reality. It is therefore with great gratitude that I share my experience with the Ring of Light.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Dieudonne B.<\/strong><\/em>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_testimonial quote_icon_color=&#8221;rgba(36,186,191,0.54)&#8221; admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignages&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.7.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; body_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; author_text_align=&#8221;right&#8221; author_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221;]I&#8217;m walking up a hill floating in the air a few feet above the ground and at one point I realize this is a dream so I&#8217;m heading for a precipice. I am quite impressed with the height, but I know that I am not risking anything since I am dreaming ; I continue to float towards the precipice and I have the impression that it is a certain way of breathing ( pneumophene with retention) which allows me to keep this control of the floating in the air\u2026 I then undertake to start a flight . A discovery of the region. In my dream (experience), I am amazed by the beauty of what I see (I do not fly very fast), I always keep this idea in mind of fixing a detail of the decor and not its globality so as not to lose this lucidity (as I learned during the training)\u2026 I have the impression after a while that I recognize certain landscapes\u2026 Today, I am completely out of all those personal development techniques that had never done to feed a sensitivity that has become invading and beliefs that I was able to cleanse with phosphenes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Philippe L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I am more confident, more motivated, then with the vertical swing I had several awakenings in the night and was able to control a dream. Nice experience ! this had never happened to me before. Then, after taking the practical course in astral unfolding, I had an experience ; I was in my room and saw myself sleeping.

I see splendid landscapes, the most beautiful was a kind of Bavarian castle in the snow and the pines next to an icy lake. I have the impression that there are very recurring places in my dreams, and I go there every week : Deserted urban environment, old disused house, lost village sparsely inhabited in unknown lands, summer camps.

But one day, I saw my double as a beautiful woman like a goddess. Since then my male part has become quite strong and my intuitions are numerous and I have never known this inner balance that I find in me now. It&#8217;s a relationship with myself that I didn&#8217;t know yet.<br \/>\nOne evening I saw the Seal of Solomon growing so much that it took up all the space. The colors were beautiful (green, blue, purple, red and yellow) it was not turning, it was getting bigger and bigger. I am becoming more and more intuitive, positive.

I was scared, I thought I was dying, but the experience itself was not scary. Then I was propelled towards the earth towards the African continent and as close as possible, I perceived a grid of small squares. A small square drew me closer, it looked like a TV screen in which there was a woman holding the hand of a little boy dressed in red and I felt that boy was me. A voice in me said this sentence : I will take care of you. What was amazing was that I was moving around in that space without being seen, and during that time I was trying to wiggle my foot to get back into my body and then I came back into my body.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Thierry B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I have had good experience with the full body side sway with my hips being the base.

There was then formation of a phosphene at this location. And it was as if my mind invited this phosphene to come and incarnate in me. Then, I saw my brain in the air where this phosphene had formed. There were dark spots in places in my brain. These spots disappeared one after the other under the effect of the phosphene resulting from the flash of light with which this experiment began. In the end, my brain was uniformly bright and luminous.<br \/>\nI also had a revelation in a dream, that the phase of diffused glow is the phase where transformations take place for the fulfillment of desires. I intend to deepen this revelation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean Enokou K.

I say visions and not dreams because they are brief images that appear to me, and I wake up immediately, as if to remember this vision. These are images that give me information about people, or the answers I get to a question I have asked myself, or, and it often happens, premonitory images.<br \/>\nI would say in conclusion that since my practice, my perceptions are refined. And it is obvious if I do my session in the evening before bedtime. So, I take advantage of it when I need an answer to a question that I ask myself. Having said that, I don&#8217;t necessarily have the vision the night itself, but sometimes the next night and sometimes I have a picture that I don&#8217;t understand at all.<br \/>\nIn fact, I have the feeling of opening onto something immense without really knowing what\u2026 as if I was connected to an immensity, or to a space. And that, I would say almost permanently. Or as if my own space had expanded. A feeling also of being connected to a lot of things and especially in full consciousness, of having the mind sometimes very far, very high. What amazes me is to still feel well anchored in the earth. This feeling of expanse is found in all directions. It&#8217;s not easy to explain that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Ghislaine M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>With the swings, I feel full of energy, calmer and more confident in myself.

Learning is much easier with phosphenes. I recently learned all the flags of the cities of the world and their respective capitals. I was impressed with how quickly you remember. Too bad this method is not chosen for learning for students, with light and rhythmic thinking ! I am in awe of Dr. Lefebure&#8217;s videos for his humor, the extent of his knowledge and the simple way to explain Phosphenism, he is a rare personality that we unfortunately rarely meet. I bought his book on Phosphenism over 30 years ago, found it when I signed up for the online training.

A great energy came over me. I had this feeling of being projected into the cosmos and seeing the Earth very small and bright. I felt light, filled with peace and joy, free with a lot of warmth in my body and in my hands. I stayed on my bed for a long time taking advantage of this moment. It also happens often during the day to have the sensation that my body is also swinging with the point of concentration and often before falling asleep.<br \/>\nSince I started the training, I have more control over stress, alertness, situations that unblock naturally with people, a more subtle perception of things.

Some trees move aside to let me pass. Other birds join my flight. Strident but harmonious songs burst forth from all sides. A lake in the distance, I dive into it, come out even lighter, and especially more powerful. An indescribable force that takes me to travel crazy distances. I fly over dazzling snow-capped mountains, sparkling with light, an icy cold invades me, then they are deserts of dark orange sand, and there reigns an enormous heat, I wake up calmly, serenely. A &#8221; divine &#8221; force accompanied me for several days and something different, like a deeper discernment, a &#8221; fluid &#8221; pragmatism took hold .

In the past, I had taken the time to study different initiatory orders before knowing Phosphenism. The work carried out by Dr Francis Lefebure is really of a very high level, there is no equivalence.

And it all makes so much sense.<br \/>\nI thank you with all my heart, as well as Doctor Lefebure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Cat.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>In the middle of the night, I heard a very loud whirring and immediately I had the sensation of spinning at a vertiginous speed &#8230; It stopped suddenly, and there, I was as if expelled from my body with the feeling of being like an elastic band that stretches towards infinity. I was aware of merging with the universe. I saw planets, galaxies with colors and luminosity difficult to describe in words\u2026 I don&#8217;t know how long the experience really lasted, but I woke up with phenomenal energy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Yannick L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Today I started to see the videos of the second level, and there, hearing Professor Lefebure speak, I was very intrigued by what he was saying.<br \/>\nIn fact, it took me back to my childhood. Since I was little, I played alone when my mother corrected her students&#8217; papers by correspondence. I spent long hours alone in the room I shared with my parents. I would sit in front of the window and amuse myself staring at the ball of a pen until all I could see was a bright light. I would swing back and forth or sideways until I could see people or figures in the ballpoint pen. I stared at the sun in the daytime, then closed my eyes to trap the light in my eyelids and played at bringing the sunny image to a single point, and sometimes making it dance. I understood when I was little that when I did this, and that before I fell asleep at night I stared at my parents&#8217; bedside lamp while concentrating on seeing the rest of the Zorro episode, I could during my dream see the next episode. It lasted a long time. My mother didn&#8217;t believe me.<br \/>\nThen I continued as a young adult to &#8221; see the future &#8221; in the mirror of the gemstone of my ring. I had the feeling of being able to project myself into the place of the image. This is how I started to wake up astral travel. My boyfriend lived in Brazil and I in Paris, I &#8221; connected &#8221; to him via the sunlight reflecting in the mirror of my ring.<br \/>\nI use the same technique to rest and clear my mind when doing meditation in the oratory in front of a candle flame. And I have always noticed that it is during this kind of exercise that the most accurate inspirations come to me, like remote guidance from the outside.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Laurence E.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I regularly practice the suggested exercises. I find the sessions well explained and marked by benevolence. The progressiveness of the training and the resulting experiences are stimulating and encourage me to continue training.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Christian M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Following the rotation exercises (which I loved), I woke up twice one night. I was shaking all over my body as if I was in a static contraction, but more so, as it felt like my heart was beating harder and my whole being was vibrating. That&#8217;s exactly the feeling\u2026 it was awesome.<br \/>\nI was hoping to leave my body, I tried to activate an idea of rotation, but it only intensified the sensation, then it subsided and disappeared.<br \/>\nI remember a lot of dreams. The last one that marked me is a dream where I plunged into a body of water and I kept going up, so much so that I lacked air. I ended up taking a breath. I thought I was going to drown, but actually no. I was breathing underwater, suddenly I said to myself: above all, don&#8217;t go back up, keep going\u2026 it&#8217;s great, you breathe underwater\u2026 take advantage of it\u2026 and in addition it&#8217;s a dream that you can lead waow ! Two first times at the same time\u2026 And there\u2026 pff\u2026 my husband woke me up to go to work.<br \/>\n&#8211; tremor is the lightning speed in the dark, 1 000 000 000 plus faster than the largest 8, that is why the heart beats faster pfff &#8230; and even fear, g\u00e9nialllllll !<br \/>\n&#8211; I&#8217;ve only been doing breaths for 2 days, about 3 hours in all in 2 days\u2026 and things are moving\u2026 waow !<br \/>\nThank you thank you thank you<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Fran\u00e7oise D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Thanks to Phosphenism, I regain my self-confidence and begin to feel the energies again, and just for that, I would like to thank the immense work of Dr Lefebure , Daniel Stiennon , for this school which highlights all that some do not us do not explain, for lack of knowing or wanting to keep power &#8230;<br \/>\nA big thank you to all those who work in the team for the development and the good of all.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Catherine F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>This training suits me perfectly. It is structured and structuring. I feel like I am laying a very solid foundation. The feelings are very positive on the emotional and psychic level, feeling that everything lights up. All this, without being dogmatic or even sectarian. For a few years now, I have been exploring the spiritual and esoteric world in search of concrete experiences and knowledge\u2026 I have finally found my way !<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Laurent M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_divider color=&#8221;#800000&#8243;
