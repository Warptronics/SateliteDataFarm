In the light of Doctor Francis Lefebure&#8217;s discoveries in cerebral physiology, it is possible to understand the mechanisms that govern the exchanges of energy between human beings and to distinguish reality from fiction. Dr\u00a0Lefebure, a French physician and scientist, based his research on the systematic use of the phosphenes. The phosphenes are all the subjective sensations of light, i.e. those which are not directly provoked by light hitting the retina. They can be produced by focusing shortly on sources of light. Dr\u00a0Lefebure and his collaborators practiced many experiments of phosphenic telepathy and discovered unknown laws of cerebral physiology.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to preconceived ideas, it is not possible to invest another person&#8217;s brain at a distance and impose our thoughts to them. Rhythmic thinking, on the contrary, is easy to transmit by telepathy. Rhythm structures thoughts and gives them extra power. To understand this concept better, let us quote this example by Dr\u00a0Lefebure: the analogy between wind and thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201fThoughts are like the anarchic masses of air: they have a lot of energy, but its effect is weak. The wind does not go through walls, for example. But, when a rhythm is induced in the air, for example by producing a sound, it can easily go through walls, though its energy is billion of times weaker than the energy of the wind. The difference is due to the rhythm of the energy. Similarly, when the air is carried in a rhythmic spiral movement, it acquires a fantastic power that can destroy entire cities and regions, in the form of tornadoes and typhoons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rhythmic thinking, projected on a person, amplifies their cerebral rhythms and consequently their thoughts. The content of the thoughts of the receiver is thus essential and it is this factor that defines the results of the operation. Cerebral rhythms are neutral. Even if the emitter desperately tries to transmit negative thoughts, they will not influence the quality of the energy that is transmitted. This quality is determined by the level of practice of the emitter.<\/p>\n<p>Vital energy and cerebral rhythms are not intrinsically good or bad. It is the quality of the thoughts activated by this energy that matters. As a simple comparison, gasoline can be used as fuel for a vehicle, but also can be used to start a blaze. The same way, energy amplifies the thoughts of the receiver in a neutral fashion, the good ones as well as the bad ones. Thus,\u00a0it is the state of mind of the receiver that determines the effects of the transmission of energy. The environment and the atmosphere in which the receiver lives have a major influence on his or her thoughts, social and cultural factors also modify the view of the world of the individual.<\/p>\n<p>Dr\u00a0Lefebure wrote the following analogy: cerebral rhythms are like a suction pump and the thoughts of the individual are like the tank to which this pump is connected. Cerebral rhythms amplify thoughts. They energize them and intensify them. Consequently, one must be careful and use cerebral rhythms wisely.<\/p>\n<p>Cerebral rhythms, increasing thoughts tenfold, amplify the beliefs and the biases of the receiver. This operation can be very negative if the person is too impregnated with certain popular beliefs. A general feeling of persecution hangs over the cultures where the folklore includes witchcraft, bewitchment and sorcery. Amplified by the rhythms, this feeling can become genuine parano\u00efa. The wrong kind of litterature also has a similar effect of suggestion. The persons who are conditioned by these factors often believe they are under a malevolent influence and wish to be exorcised, when the evil simply lays within their own psyche. The process is purely psychological: a suggestion is countered by another suggestion.<\/p>\n<p>Nature and the cosmos are not human inventions, and thus do no carry any biases. They are pure and do not convey any negative concepts. Is a flower hostile? Does a star want to hurt you? No, unless you are utterly parano\u00efd\u2026 Rather than letting yourself be inspired by litterature of poor quality or by primitive superstitions, why not let yourself be carried by the energies of nature and of the cosmos?<\/p>\n<p>Also check:\u00a0Influence at a distance<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exercise of Phosphenic Mixing:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0Choose an image related to nature or the cosmos (a tree, a flower, the sea, a mountain, a star, a galaxy, etc.)<br \/>&#8211;\u00a0Do a phosphene.<br \/>&#8211;\u00a0Contemplate the image you have chosen for 15 to 45\u00a0minutes, using a photograph or, even better, contemplating the element itself directly (choose a tree or a star, for example, and contemplate that object), do a new phosphene everytime you think it is necessary.<br \/>&#8211;\u00a0Subsequently (maybe once you are back home), do a phosphene and visualize the image you have contemplated in your mind&#8217;s eye.<br \/>&#8211;\u00a0Try to remember how it looked like. Visualize this object within the phosphene.<br \/>&#8211;\u00a0Do a fresh phosphene roughly every 5 minutes. Practice this exercise during 15 to 45\u00a0minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Added to the practice of rhythmic thinking, this exercise will allow you to direct your energy in a direction that is at the same time inspiring and safe. If you repeat this exercise regularly, you will soon experience dreams or consciousness extensions that are related to the image you have chosen\u2026<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar orientation=&#8221;right&#8221; area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_9&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Click Image&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;|700|||||||&#8221; header_text_align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_7&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Understanding&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; width=&#8221;99.2%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;|26px||||&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_font_size=&#8221;10px&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#d3d3d3&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;10px|10px|10px|10px|false|false&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Importante Note<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have done our best to provide you with the most accurate translation of our french website.
