Focusing on the reflection of the candles in the crystal ball produces a phosphene. It is within this phosphene that they perceive visions.<\/p>\n<p>Doctor Francis Lefebure, a French physician and scientist, discovered the principles underlying these practices by systematically using the phosphenes. He then designed a revolutionary method of personal and spiritual development: Phosphenism. The phosphenes are all the subjective sensations of light, i.e. those which are not directly produced by light stimulating the retina. They can be produced by focusing shortly on sources of light<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thought-forms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The term \u201fclairvoyance\u201d could be replaced more accurately by \u201fthought-forms reading\u201d. The concept of \u201fthought-form\u201d comes from Theosophy, a doctrine which states that when people think about a thing, an image of their thought is created in a subtle matter and remains in their aura. It is these thought-forms that the clairvoyants perceive in their visual chaos.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, an architect who is designing a house start by representing it in his mind&#8217;s eye. He starts with the overall shape, then goes on to the details, the problems and the solutions, thus creating a thought-form of his project in his aura.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of clairvoyants read the thought-forms of their clients. Of course, interpreting these perceptions can be tricky and mistakes can be made. Nevertheless, these are authentic phenomena of clairvoyance.<\/p>\n<p>In his\u00a0Complete Course of Phosphenism, Dr\u00a0Lefebure relates the following story: the victim of a theft asks an African mystic to help him find out the identity of the thief. The sorcerer contemplates the reflection of the sun on water in a calabash and transmits the vision to the person consulting, like Nostradamus did for Catherine of Medici. The victim can perceive the image of the thief in the reflection of the sun on water, as all phenic phenomena can be transmitted telepathically. But, let us suppose that the victim suspected somebody already. However accurate his suspicion, a thought-form will be created in his mind that the sorcerer can perceive. This illustrates the fact that one should be careful when interpreting clairvoyance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Stiennon relates:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I met a clairvoyant: Madame Gisky. Doctor Lefebure had talked to me a lot about her. As a child, she had developed clairvoyance by practicing Phosphenism instinctively; and like all the children who played with the phosphenes and used the rythmo-phosphenic function of the brain, she had developed lifelong abilities of divination. Only this kind of practice can develop authentic clairvoyance abilities.<\/p>\n<p>We talked for three hours. The main subject of our conversation was the dangers of clairvoyance. Here are a few things she told me and that seemed very wise and clever to me. I understand why Dr\u00a0Lefebure decided to mention her case in his book:\u00a0Phosphenism and the Origins of Religion. This woman is worth meeting: the words she speaks are incredibly rich.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201f(\u2026)These abilities are not a power, they should serve to direct the future.\u201d<\/em><br \/><em>\u201fLet we warn you: clairvoyance is dangerous. I have learned to use it in a different way.\u201d<\/em><br \/><em>\u201f\u2026 in order to understand things, one needs to experience them.\u201d<\/em><br \/><em>\u201fOne should not let anyone predict the future for them. All human beings can do this for themselves!\u201d<\/em><br \/><em>\u201fSeek within the phosphene.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Here is an anecdote that she related to me:<\/em><br \/><em>\u201fOne day, a lady came to consult me. Once the clairvoyance was finished, as she was leaving, she said:<\/em><br \/><em>&#8211;\u00a0You are a bad clairvoyant. You did not fulfill my expectation, though people had told me you were the best.<\/em><br \/><em>&#8211;\u00a0But, madame, I answered, I know very well why he you came to consult me: you wish to know the date when your husband will die!<\/em><br \/><em>&#8211;\u00a0Ah, you see, you can predict the future.<\/em><br \/><em>&#8211;\u00a0Of course I can, but how do you know you will not die first.<\/em><br \/><em>Stunned, she did not say any more.<\/em><br \/><em>&#8211;\u00a0Fifteen years ago, you went to see a clairvoyant who \u201bpredicted\u2019 that your husband was going to die, without giving you a precise date. Since then, you have been consulting every clairvoyant around, wishing to obtain this date. And every clairvoyant you consulted told you that your husband is going to die, only because the first clairvoyant had told you so. Of course he is going to die, like everyone else, but nothing proves that he will die before you.<\/em><br \/><em>Because you were so impressed by the prediction of this first clairvoyant, you created a thought-form that all the other clairvoyants perceived. All this happened because you have had a lover for the last 15\u00a0years and that you wish your husband dies so that you can be with him!<\/em><br \/><em>&#8211;\u00a0You have wasted 15\u00a0years seeking an answer that you do not need. Do you really think that your husband must die for you to change your life?\u2026\u201d<\/em><br \/><em>Her conclusion was:<\/em><br \/><em>\u201fI sometimes perceive the mediums that other clairvoyants have used for their reading: one time I even saw the tarot cards a person had drawn during a previous consultation with another clairvoyant.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Exercises\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For these exercises, you will need a pen and paper.<br \/>Choose a touchy subject: a conflict, a concern, a project\u2026<br \/>Do a phosphene while concentrating on this theme.<br \/>During the presence of the phosphene, write down all the ideas that appear.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Practicing clairvoyance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You will need a pen and a paper.<br \/>Choose a person about whom you wish to experience a clairvoyance phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>First phosphene:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While focusing on a lamp, let ideas flow, impressions, sensations related to this person.<br \/>Switch the lamp off.<br \/>Let your thoughts flow during the presence of the phosphene.<br \/>Remember memories related to this person.<br \/>Write down the important elements that come to your mind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Second phosphene:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Switch your lamp back on and, while focusing on it, think about what you have just written down. Try to visualize the person in different circumstances, in different contexts. Let your thoughts flow.<br \/>Switch the lamp off.<br \/>Again, write down the new ideas that have appeared.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Third phosphene:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Switch your lamp on and, while focusing on the light, keep thinking about what you have just written.<br \/>Switch your lamp off.<br \/>Ask yourself questions.<br \/>First question: what is this person&#8217;s character?<br \/>Let ideas and impressions related to this question come to your mind. The image of this person will change, expressing his or her character.<\/p>\n<p>By proceeding this way and asking several questions, you will observe that the image you have of this person changes, sometimes in a surprising manner.<br \/>Write down carefully any new impressions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fourth phosphene:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Switch your lamp on and, while focusing on it, think about what you have just written down.<br \/>Switch your lamp off. Close your eyes. Ask yourself the following question:<br \/>What could be his or her deepest inspirations, his or her tendencies?<br \/>Observe the evolution of your thoughts. This can lead you to the perception of this person practicing an activity that he or she does not practice yet, but that would be perfectly suited for him or her.<br \/>If you have difficulties perceiving scenes, experiencing visions or flashes, ask yourself questions instead.<br \/>Once this experiment over, carefully write down the kind of images that came to your mind, as well as the impressions and the sensations that they have provoked.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fifth phosphene:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Switch your lamp on and, while focusing on it, think about what your have written in a global way.<br \/>Switch your lamp off.<br \/>Now, in a panoramic way, let all the main points that have appeared since the beginning of this exercise come back to your mind.<br \/>Write down one last time the main ideas that come out of this final Mixing. From all these notes, the main tendencies the chosen person will surface.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You have certainly been able to observe a great difference between reflection during the presence of the phosphene and reflection without the phosphene. The first ideas that appear are not necessarily the most original ones; but there are already more organized and more logical. The deductive reasoning and the thought processes are of a much better quality; and you will generally be able to observe one or two new ideas of better than usual quality. During the following phosphenes, ideas become stronger and more original.<\/p>\n<p>When you wish to obtain answers to problems brought to you by clients, remember to place their queries in a phosphene. You will obtain many more solutions by associations of ideas.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar orientation=&#8221;right&#8221; area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_9&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Click Image&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;|700|||||||&#8221; header_text_align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_7&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Understanding&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; width=&#8221;99.2%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;|26px||||&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_font_size=&#8221;10px&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#d3d3d3&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;10px|10px|10px|10px|false|false&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Importante Note<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have done our best to provide you with the most accurate translation of our french website.
