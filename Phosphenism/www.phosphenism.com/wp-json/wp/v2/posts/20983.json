Researchers such as Professor Rhine have accumulated a lot of statistics which have never proved anything. Therefore, telepathy remains confined to marginal research in fringe parapsychological centres.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the discoveries in cerebral physiology of Doctor\u00a0Francis Lefebure, a French physician and researcher, allow a better understanding of these phenomena and the mechanisms which produce them. His discoveries are based on the systematic use of the phosphenes. The phosphenes are all the subjective sensations of light, i.e. those which are not directly caused by light stimulating the cells of the retina. The phosphenes illustrate the rhythmic functions of the brain and demonstrate the existence of cerebral rhythms, which can be developed and maintained by practicing rhythmic thinking exercises. Rhythm structures thoughts, improving attention, memory, organisational skills and creativity. During their research, Dr\u00a0Lefebure and his collaborators realized that the phosphenes and rhythmic thinking are easy to transmit by telepathy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EXPERIMENTING WITH THE TELEPATHIC TRANSMISSION OF THE PHOSPHENES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201fIn ordinary conditions of experimentation, the telepathic transmissibility of the phosphenes is very important, much more than ordinary thoughts.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If one focuses on a red spot on a white wall for about 30\u00a0seconds, and then either looks away or covers it up, one sees a green spot appear. This spot is a phosphene and green is the complementary colour of red.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Mr\u00a0Delay, experimenting with discs of various colours that a transmitting subject (the transmitter) focused on, noticed that another subject sitting nearby and wearing an eye patch (the receiver), perceived a phosphene. This phenomenon did not occur while the transmitter was focusing on the disc, but while he was perceiving the complementary colour. The phosphene perceived by the receiver was of the same colour as the phosphene perceived by the transmitter, rather than of the original colour of the disc.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>It is during this experiment that Mr\u00a0Delay noticed that the transmission of the phosphenes does not follow the laws that are usually accepted for telepathy. The telepathic transmission of the phosphenes actually depends on both the distance between the transmitter and the receiver and their relative position. The nearer the receiver is from the transmitter, the better the transmission is. The telepathic transmission of the phosphenes is also improved if the two subjects are facing each other.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>It is possible to induce particular rhythms to the phosphenes. For example, if two lamps are placed so that each eye of the subject only sees one lamp, and that these lamps are lit alternatively at a rhythm of two seconds, the two phosphenes produced do not coexist but alternate at a rhythm that is characteristic of the subject.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>On average, this rhythm is of eight seconds per side and the alternation of the phosphenes lasts roughly three minutes.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>It is interesting to note that the regularity of this rhythm conveys much information on the condition of the brain and on the influence that drugs or diet can have on it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>But, it is even more interesting to note that during these experiments of telepathy, the alternation of the double phosphenes was provoked in a subject who was located in a different room and who did not know what kind of phosphene was being transmitted. The receiver clearly perceived two phosphenes, alternating at the same rhythm as the two phosphenes perceived by the transmitter. (Experiment carried out by Mr Raoul Violay).<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Even though you might not want to get involved in such complex experiments, you can observe that if you do a phosphene, it is quite easy to transmit it to another person located near you and who has not focused on the light. Moreover, now that you are aware of how easy it is to transmit phosphenes by telepathy, you will notice in everyday life, spontaneous cases that might otherwise have gone unnoticed.\u201d<\/em><br \/>Extract from\u00a0Phosphenism, a <em>new explanation of the origins of religion.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The definition of phosphenic telepathy, or initiatory telepathy, is different from the definition of telepathy that is usually accepted. Dr\u00a0Lefebure\u2019s research demonstrated that rhythmic thinking, when it has been developed by practice, is easy to transmit to other people. Thus, the term \u201fphosphenic telepathy\u201d means \u201ftransmission of rhythmic thinking\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Rhythmic thinking, induced in other people, will produce a movement in their thoughts which is not necessarily equivalent to the transmitted movement. The perception of this movement can take place in a variety of ways: either by images (for example the image of downhill skiing, of ascending in a hot air balloon, of the movement of a clock pendulum, etc.), synaesthesian sensations (the sensation of being on a boat), or by both forms of perception simultaneously.<\/p>\n<p><strong>AN EXPERIMENT OF PHOSPHENIC TELEPATHY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For this experiment, you will need a transmitting and a receiving subject (which we will refer to as \u201fthe transmitter\u201d and \u201fthe receiver\u201d). The transmitter can place him\/herself behind the receiver or they can face each other. The transmitter does a phosphene, projects it on the receiver and induces a rhythmic thought in the form of a moving dot of light. In the beginning of the experiment, the transmitter can make the spot move in a lateral pendular motion. The best rhythm to use is the rhythm of two seconds: one second to the right, one second to the left. In order to follow a very precise rhythm, a metronome can be used. The receiver should keep his\/her eyes shut and remain attentive to the sensations and images that might appear, especially the ones of a rhythmic nature.<\/p>\n<p>Induced rhythmic thinking has a profound action and can help unlocking certain psychic abilities. This explains why certain highly spiritual persons can trigger powerful spiritual phenomena in others, thanks to these techniques. This is the true meaning of Initiation: the triggering of energies that will help the expression and the realization of the abilities people truly have within themselves.<\/p>\n<p>The implications of phosphenic telepathy are actually very profound, as it creates a relationship that involves deep feelings. This form of telepathy is much richer than the simple transmission of figures and shapes. What is involved here is a more complete understanding of another individual through the feelings one receives. This goes beyond the superficial language that we express ourselves with and which limitations do not allow us to describe certain of our feelings. Phosphenic telepathy might even be the \u201flost common language\u201d mentioned in some legends: the famous story of the Tower of Babel in the Old Testament, for example.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar orientation=&#8221;right&#8221; area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_9&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Click Image&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;|700|||||||&#8221; header_text_align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_7&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Understanding&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; width=&#8221;99.2%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;|26px||||&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_font_size=&#8221;10px&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#d3d3d3&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;10px|10px|10px|10px|false|false&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Importante Note<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have done our best to provide you with the most accurate translation of our french website.
