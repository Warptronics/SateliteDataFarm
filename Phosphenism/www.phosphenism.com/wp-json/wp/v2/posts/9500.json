sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]Several years ago, I had come across Dr. Lefebure&#8217;s books. After seeing Daniel Stiennon&#8217;s presentation, I signed up for the online training that I find very good and very practical.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Alain P.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I had heard about Phosphenism for a good twenty years without ever having practiced it. Nevertheless, I found Dr. Lefebure&#8217;s books intriguing and interesting. I had skimmed a few of them, but I had trouble getting started.<br \/>\nI felt that I needed help into my practice. I discovered Daniel Stiennon&#8217;s training courses on the Internet and I decided to jump in. Thanks to him for making this science accessible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Fabien G.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I have already had great experiences with Phosphenism and yet, I am only at the beginning.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Myriame<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I knew Phosphenism thanks to my father who, when I was a child, made me practice the Phosphenic Mixing applied in Education. I can affirm that it is thanks to this that I succeeded in doing my studies with facility. I have been practicing Phosphenism for four years now.<br \/>\nAt the beginning, from some ebooks, but it is especially by following the courses of Daniel Stiennon that I understood all the extent of the practice and that I succeeded in living a great number of experiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Ricardo D. F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>When I was very young, I read a book of Dr. Lefebure, the &#8220;Phosphenic Mixing applied to Education&#8221;, but I did not pass the first step of practicing this teaching. Later on, I found again the Phosphenism thanks to the internet.<br \/>\nI saw it as a &#8220;sign of destiny&#8221; and I started to practice it assiduously during the autumn. I started to dream in color, to remember my dreams and sometimes to fly during dreams. Even though there are still ups and downs in my daily life, I have a good feeling now that I am a being in the becoming.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Marc N.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I discovered Phosphenism while doing research on telepathy. I was immediately seduced by the numerous videos and the richness of the teaching at our disposal on the site. While listening to the first courses, I experienced my first out-of-body experience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Fran\u00e7oise<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I stumbled upon the Youtube video &#8221; Initiatic Experiences &#8221; absolutely by chance. The next week, I took the subscription and ordered almost all the books, because it was exactly what I was looking for a long time. Now, Phosphenism is a complete part of my life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Baptiste C.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I discovered Dr. Lefebure via the internet. I was immediately seduced by the methods presented. I quickly had an irresistible desire to follow the complete training. Since then, my life and my being have been transformed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Fabrice<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I discovered Phosphenism by chance and this, after a few years of practice of Yoga and Qi-Gong. If my initiation practice has been up and down, I can affirm that Phosphenism has never left me, and I will even say more, it has been a support in order to stay upright and to advance step by step in everyday life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Patrick F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I discovered the Phosphenism while I was researching the benefits of light therapy and since then, this technique has become my only passion. It is always with great pleasure and interest that I consult the levels and that I realize the suggested exercises. I have been lucky enough to have extraordinary experiences which led me to exceptional spiritual realizations.<br \/>\nThis new initiatic process has revolutionized my life. My congratulations and thanks to Daniel Stiennon for using very sophisticated means to make the Phosphenism accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Lysse Y.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I am starting to integrate it more and more naturally into my daily life. It&#8217;s a real happiness.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>L\u00e9o<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>It has only been a few months since I started the second part of my training and I am passionate about it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Claire T.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>For some time I had been looking for something other than the so-called personal development methods to really understand what was driving me. I think I have found the approach that suits me best with Phosphenism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Pierre F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Although I have been initiated into many hermeticisms and brotherhoods, Dr. Lefebure&#8217;s work has always held a special place in my life. It is the same for his successor Daniel Stiennon who is his worthy successor. A training of very high initiatic and esoteric quality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Louis D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I discovered Phosphenism recently. I am an admirer of the Dr. Lefebure and Mr. Stiennon&#8217;s work. My research started with personal development, then I discovered the New Age, then I came to the Gospels, then to shamanism, and now to Phosphenism. I am really motivated. I enjoy my swaying sessions more and more.<br \/>\nI have been doing one session a day for the moment and now, I am going to double or even triple my efforts. What has surprised me the most so far are the internal swaying movements during the physical sways.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>S\u00e9bastien D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>At now more than 65 years old, I have taken a great number of training courses in many fields. So I know how to recognize those which can really bring something. I regret not having known Dr. Lefebure&#8217;s work earlier; it would have saved me a lot of lost time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Philippe S.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>During the lateral sways with the OM mantra and a visualization of a Buddhist temple perched in high mountains, bathed in an intense light, but warm and pleasant in a clear blue sky, I felt a sensation of lightness with visualization of my own person inside the temple, but also outside, always sitting cross-legged at the edge of the void with this feeling of being able to move freely to different places between temple and mountain. A sensation of being one with the elements while being independent and free of any movement without fear or dread.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Nicolas G. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>The experiment that I realize very often is to use Phosphenism to unblock experimental steps for which I encounter difficulties in my research work in the laboratory.<br \/>\nFor several weeks, I try to make materials with a well defined experimental protocol. But I was not able to achieve my aims because one of the steps did not work. After several tries, I decided one evening to mix all the different steps of the synthesis with phosphene.<br \/>\nI did my anterior-posterior swaying exercise by visualizing each step of the experiment. Once asleep, I dreamed the whole experiment in great detail and when I reached the crucial step, I used a very short time to add a reagent. The next morning, I reproduce the experiment as it was done in the dream and everything was perfect.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Teko N. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>One night in the dark, I thought of a patient who seemed to be doing quite well. But a scene of an evacuation in a resuscitation unit came to my mind. I thought it was a bad dream due to fatigue. The event took place 2 days later and I had many questions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Dominique M. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Two months ago, I had an experience which really touched me. It was during a session of lateral sways. At a given moment, with my eyes closed, a kind of veil\/curtain rises quickly in front of my eyes and I see the face of a man and a child (I don&#8217;t know if it was a girl or a boy) that I don&#8217;t know.<br \/>\nIn the same session, still with my eyes closed, I saw successively :<br \/>\n&#8211; behind my back, the room where I am practicing, as if I were looking in front of me with my eyes open ;<br \/>\n&#8211; some steep steps which pass quickly by descending them with the eyes;<br \/>\n&#8211; a side wall which scrolls upwards and then, suddenly, I find myself projected into space, surrounded by the stars.<br \/>\nEach time, the fear felt causes the vision\/sensation to stop. I wished I could control the fear and fully experience the situation\/sensation, but I couldn&#8217;t and it all dissolved, causing the veil on the vision to come down just as quickly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Giovanna C. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Since I have been practicing Phosphenism, my thoughts are clearer and I have developed a greater inner calm.<br \/>\nI also notice effects on my dreams that I remember more easily.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Olivier S. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>The complete training that I have been following for more than a year now is a very rich and inspiring source that I enjoy working and studying. It has an obvious impact on my personality.<br \/>\nI especially remember that Phosphenism develops the best in us. The regular practice of mixing the thinking with phosphenes leads us exponentially towards the best of ourselves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Pierre B. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I am very satisfied with the training. Having a course which opens at regular intervals forces one to be involved in the training every day and this is very motivating.<br \/>\nThanks to the regular practice of the exercises, my awareness of my dreams, which I had hardly remembered before, has increased greatly. Thank you again for this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Bertrand R. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>This training has given me new skills, more feeling, and more and more detailed dreams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Anne B. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>When I reach a good concentration in the exercises, I feel moments of floating, fullness and well-being. During these moments, the notion of time disappears, and the practices become pleasant and sometimes allow me to reach an enlargement of consciousness. Then, the practices are no longer felt as a constraint, an obligation, a necessity to reach the level of self-knowledge and self-realization; a way to enter into myself to discover myself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>John T. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>The course &#8220;The Secret of Secrets&#8221; is certainly one of the many most powerful courses in Phosphenism. In this course, Mr. Stiennon reveals teachings that I had never heard of even though I have been in the esoteric world for more than 50 years.<br \/>\nThe teaching is of a very high level and has no equivalent elsewhere. I can say loud and clear that anyone who wants to change their life condition should follow this training.<br \/>\nIn this one, Mr. Stiennon goes far beyond the undeniable contributions of Dr. Lefebure. He opens the doors to the esoteric aspect (hidden knowledge) of Phosphenism.<br \/>\nWhat surprises me the most is that although the phosphene is as visible as the nose in the middle of a face, no one before Dr. Lefebure had drawn our attention to it and its amazing possibilities.<br \/>\nThe same is true of all the contributions of Mr. Stiennon. I am sure that history will remember him as an &#8220;inspired&#8221; man, as were the prophets in their time (a person inspired by the divinity, who predicts the future and reveals hidden truths).<br \/>\nThe fact of having received the supreme initiation (by imposition of hands) from Dr. Lefebure and under particular conditions could only play a great role.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Michel L. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>A vast and complete training. If I have one regret, it is that I was absent from it for eight months because of travel. The course content is magnificent. With my sincere congratulations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Marc C. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>A high quality training with a complete program. The teaching is well structured and progressive enough, especially for beginner students. The follow-up of the students is courteous, kind and hyper reactive. Congratulations!<br \/>\nThis training has given me the first tools to go deeper into what I really am. It is in the &#8220;initiatic&#8221; field or the &#8220;access to information&#8221; that I have the most results.<br \/>\nAll my gratitude for the work of Dr. Lefebure and for Mr. Stiennon his worthy spiritual heir.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Mickael Z. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>[\/et_pb_testimonial][et_pb_testimonial quote_icon_color=&#8221;rgba(36,186,191,0.54)&#8221; admin_label=&#8221;T\u00e9moignages&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.10.8&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; body_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; author_text_align=&#8221;right&#8221; author_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]This training is both rich in theoretical knowledge and practical exercises.

I still have a long way to go, but from the first level, I had some dreams of flying and, as I progressed through the steps, I noticed that my mental energy was much better in terms of memory, concentration and comprehension. My general balance is also improved. Phosphenism is a source of obvious positive changes in my personality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Pierre B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>When I discovered Phosphenism a few months ago, I was intrigued and attracted by what it offered. What I regret is not having known it earlier. The beginning of my practice was marked by a few dreams of flight, but throughout my practice, a greater energy manifested itself through clearer ideas, a better mental, an undeniable balance as well as a greater fluency in my human relationships.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Pierre B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>This step-by-step training is a wonderful idea.

I registered in April and I don&#8217;t regret it for a moment.<br \/>\nBefore Phosphenism, I had approached several ways of personal development. I have to affirm here that in four months of practice, I obtained more than I had after 31 years of initiatic research.<br \/>\nThe only question I asked myself, why did divine providence wait so long before putting Phosphenism on my path?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Romuald<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Something extraordinary happened to me.<br \/>\nFirst, I was told in a dream that my daughter was being born and that I could clearly see her in my arms in the operating room. That very morning at dawn, during the prostration of the dawn prayer, I again had the confirmation of a daughter birth, which I had already experienced in my dream. And I began to cry with joy from that moment.<br \/>\nI went back to bed after the dawn prayer and got up to tell my wife, who did not believe me. But by dint of insisting, 2 days later, she finally agreed to take a pregnancy test and the test was positive.<br \/>\nMy wife has always been attracted to clairvoyance unlike me. And every fortune-teller used to tell her that a boy was being born.<br \/>\nSo I told her we would see the ultrasound at 4 months. Only, a divine mystery made that the umbilical cord passes between the legs and thus impossible to determine the sex until his birth.<br \/>\nFinally, I attended the birth of the baby in the operating room and I took in my arms, as in the dream, my daughter whom I called IMANE which means FAITH.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Karim H.-A.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I experienced a consciousness extension that I will name astral projection during my sleep. But I know that I was not sleeping. And I lived synchronicities in the following days. Thanks to the rhythmo-phosphenic exercises, I have another perception and the consciousness extensions allow me a connection with my guides. I feel energies more intensely for care I give.

There French translation was: this is the DIVINE.<br \/>\nThen I found myself with a group practicing Phosphenism and there I met Mr. Stiennon.<br \/>\nHe asks me: &#8220;How are you Pascal?&#8221;.<br \/>\nI answer him that I am very well, thank you. And even before I ask him any questions, he puts his right hand on my head and there, suddenly, I get out of my body and fly directly towards space at high speed.<br \/>\nThese two experiences made a strong impression on me when I woke up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Pascal V.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>Tonight, I had an incredible experience: I saw a mirror and I was playing hide and seek with my face, one time I see you, one time I don&#8217;t see you. I was swaying from right to left. Then in the morning, I felt Kundalini suddenly rise up my spine, a gentle warmth with pleasant tingling and the feeling of warmth in my head.<br \/>\nAnd there I felt the union with God.<br \/>\nIt was like a divine nectar coming down into the body, a sweet (exquisite) sweetness which went up and down without stopping.<br \/>\nThis experience left such a deep impression on me that I will ask for more.<br \/>\nAt the same time that I was living this experience and that I was in fusion with God, I said to myself &#8220;no need for a guru, just follow the teachings of Phosphenism.&#8221;<br \/>\nI would never have gotten to this point without Mr. Stiennon and his valuable teachings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Pascal<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"rgba(36,186,191,0.54)\" \/>\n<p>I discovered Phosphenism on the internet through researches on personal development. So I don&#8217;t know exactly how I ended up on the Phosphenism website. I had heard about light therapy beforehand but I was still in the dark. So I decided to go deeper.

Thank you for his knowledge which allows us to understand the rotating and rapid mantras used in Tibetan Buddhism, the Dzogchen practices with the sun and the sky, the mysticism.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Lefebure received two transmissions of &#8220;powers&#8221;, via the Zoroastrian Arth\u00e8me Galip (just as Fran\u00e7ois Brousse received one from a Zoroastrian Casrojan Ali, but unable to understand, he got a big head and thought he was Jesus), and via Pak Subub before it became a movement reported as sectarian in France.<\/p>\n<p>So, yes, I laugh at those Americans who are looking for the secrets of the Sufis&#8217; practices when I know that Dr. Lefebure studied them, as well as other Indian and Tibetan yoga exercises.<\/p>\n<p>I remember the acceleration of my out-of-body exits by practicing Gyrascopy with a record player when I was 20 years old, and an awakening of a stream of fire, which left me sweating and my entire spine in the night.<\/p>\n<p>Reading the bullshit of the Indian swamis, I thought my brain was going to burn (lol). So I stopped this awakening out of stupid fear.<\/p>\n<p>In short, yes I laugh, because I see the Sufi brotherhood body exercises and head movements, which Dr. Lefebure explained the best way to do without getting fanatical. <\/p>\n<p>Yes, I am forced to laugh at so much ignorance on the part of &#8220;masons&#8221; (freemasons).<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Lefebure and Mr. Stiennon pushed its development to such a level that I know that a disciple of a famous master of a Sufi Tariqa in Morocco left his master after meeting Mr. Stiennon.<\/p>\n<p>In order to make yoga teachers experience what they have been waiting for for years, Mr. Stiennon sometimes agrees to transmit the Initiation to them through the technique of the &#8220;3 Second Initiation&#8221;. The most powerful technique of Phosphenism.<\/p>\n<p>Even when at night we dream of flying, of moving at very high speed, we don&#8217;t even reach 1\/10th of the sensation caused by Master Stiennon when he transmits the Initiation. All this is to make it clear that it is really very powerful.<\/p>\n<p>Just as we are surprised to discover that we can produce phosphenes and marvel at its colors, so everyone is amazed to discover this possibility of our mental (psychic) faculties.<\/p>\n<p>I saw yoga teachers crying with joy who had spent many years searching for these phenomena without much effect.<\/p>\n<p>I have seen incredulous people, skeptics, but all of them, from the first experience, were fascinated by what they had achieved. I would like to remind you that Phosphenism is above all an interior and enriching experience, as Daniel Stiennon reminds us, and that this adventure can only be achieved through practice.

The thoughts swayed in the light are also very effective for me.<br \/>\nI am very happy to have committed myself to this training, because it allowed me, in a first step, to solve my insomnia problems following a burn-out.
