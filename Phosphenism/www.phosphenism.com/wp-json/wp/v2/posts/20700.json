Other translators endeavoured to study what became this poetic form when it was used in another language, along with all the mistakes and the misunderstandings which are thus generated, and here we think of Etiemble\u2019s works.<\/p>\n<p>But what do the Japanese think about this surge of enthusiasm for \u201fhaiku\u201d? Many standpoints are available on the subject. First of all there is surprise and amusement, then sometimes a certain amount of emotion, as testified by an academic in the columns of the newspaper Mainichi: \u201fThroughout the world there are people who compose poems in their own language that they call \u201bhaiku\u2019 in imitation of the Japanese \u201bhaiku\u2019. The term \u201bhaiku\u2019\u2019 is even listed in recent American and British dictionaries. We also notice poets from all over of America composing \u201bhaiku\u2019\u2019 verging on the melancholic. As is the present craze for \u201bhaiku\u2019 in Japan, it would appear that a similar phenomenon exists elsewhere. It is quite a pleasing and moving idea that the Japanese \u201bhaiku\u2019 may serve as links of friendship between people who know neither Japanese nor Japan.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Turning from amazement to action, in a reaction inspired by their legendary practical mind, the Japanese started organising international contests of \u201f\u201bhaiku\u2019 in foreign languages\u201d, such as the 5th Festival of culture in 1990 in the town of Matsuyama in the province of Ehime.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the numerous questionings which can be expressed about \u201bhaiku\u2019 from western sensitivity, beyond formula as brilliant as certain poetic writings such as: \u201fastonishment of emotion\u201d, \u201fliving herbarium of immutable truths\u201d, \u201fquest for flash of inspiration\u201d, what is a \u201fhaiku\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>First of all it is a social practice. It is a style born of poetic conjunctures (uta-awase) which took place at the Imperial Court during the Japanese Middle Ages. During these literary contests, collective creations called \u201frenga\u201d (linked verses) were developed and the \u201fhaiku\u201d originated from these. Bash\u00f4 himself led \u201fhaiku\u201d discussion groups during which he compared his experience with those of others and discussed his technique with his students. Any cultural activity, all the more if poetic, is a social activity in Japan. Within Japan today the \u201fhaiku\u201d has schools, students, reviews (recently numbering eight hundred), trends, contests and millions of followers.<\/p>\n<p>In \u201fhaiku\u201d clubs, during monthly meetings, each member\u2019s poems are the subject of debates, discussions, comments and a vote, bearing witness of authentic \u201fliterary democracy\u201d. Everything is organized in a competitive manner, each composer aiming for absolute perfection. Other characteristics anchor the \u201fhaiku\u201d much more in the specificity of a culture and reveal that it is said to be the epiphenomenon of more profound realities, more essential in the sight of fundamental considerations of the history of mankind.<\/p>\n<p>The classical \u201fhaiku\u201d, as it has been presented to us, is organized on a seventeen syllable rhythm. This is not due to chance.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the most ancient of all known Japanese poems, \u201fthe katauta\u201d, were based on this rhythm at the beginning of our era. They reproduced the breathing mode on which oral literature was then built, before the introduction of a transcription using Chinese characters. These rhythmical expressions, balanced in a \u201fquestion\/answer\u201d format, had a strong religious connotation. We also find such rhythmical expressions later in the poetry contests of the Middle Ages. The fact the \u201fhaiku\u201d first of all appears as a poetic act must not make us forget that the Japanese have for a long time been connected with poetry, from which preoccupations about their relationship with the invisible world were not missing. Historic events prove this.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the great names in Japanese history did not deign to attend poetic sessions and compose poems before a battle in order to gain the gods\u2019 favours. However, Akechi Mitsuhide, who went on to assassinate the infamous general Oda Nobunaga in 1582, took part in a \u201frenga\u201d competition the day before his crime. Fujitani Mitsue, a philosopher of the 18th century, declared in a poetic art treaty that we should break the shackles of the words which held the gods captive. Thus, the gods are present in the instance of \u201fthe inversion of words\u201d (logo), a phenomenon which consists of reversing the word or syllable order to reinforce or conceal the meaning of it. The gods of Shinto are thus compared to \u201fthe spirit of words\u201d (Kodota ma).<\/p>\n<p>Many poems in the popular tradition are considered as a magic formula where this \u2018spirit of words\u2019 becomes free by the recitation of such poems. Used for therapeutic purposes, these songs to the rhythm of thirty one syllables (seventeen syllables plus fourteen) still remind us of the relationship between magic and poetry, while other traditional civilisations claimed that all poetry is medicine. The seasonal reference any \u2018haiku\u2019 should contain is the sign that his author is \u201fin harmony with nature\u201d. This means that a compulsion to allude to a season in a poem is a kind of explicit recognition of the relative place of Humans in the Universe, where human events do not only concern human beings.<\/p>\n<p>Over the centuries, the Japanese have listed, then classified, all the signs and all the characteristic moments of each season, and compiled glossaries which increase in importance with the passing of time.<\/p>\n<p>These glossaries which contain more than 5,000 words pertaining to \u201fseasons\u201d, are what amateurs refer to before creating a \u201fhaiku\u201d poem. These poetic almanacs (known as \u201fsaijiki\u201d) are a real treasure of Japanese sensitivity. According to Inoue Teruo, a Japanese poet, they are a \u201fvery detailed collection of dates and customs commemorative of our people\u201d. These poetic almanacs are the medium of a creation of which the \u201fhaiku\u201d are only the visible result. They explain and illustrate fifteen thousand \u201fhaiku\u201d of known authors and are a reference for any new writing. The discovery and study of these almanacs give a different perspective to the practice of \u201fhaiku\u201d and enable a Japanese interpretation of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Through the \u201fseasonal vocabulary\u201d compiled in these almanacs, we can witness a permanent recreation of the universe by the Japanese people. It is because of this that the \u201fhaiku\u201d is much more than a literary event.<\/p>\n<p>Because of its history and what it is nowadays in Japan, the \u201fhaiku\u201d originates in ethno-poetry rather than poetry as envisaged by the western world.<\/p>\n<p>An interesting exercise for anyone wanting to create a \u201fhaiku\u201d or any other kind of poetry, is to practice what Dr\u00a0Lefebure calls \u201fStreaming Mixing\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Creating a \u201fhaiku\u201d under the influence of the phosphene:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do a first phosphene.<br \/>Mix an image which symbolises and summarizes the subject of your study within this phosphene. During the presence of the phosphene, you will generally come across two or three ideas that are quite different from the first one.<br \/>Choose the clearest of them and mix this second image within a second phosphene.<br \/>During this, four or five new ideas will appear, in general.<br \/>Again choose the clearest of them and from it, make up a theme that you will mix with a third phosphene.<br \/>Then ten or twelve new ideas will appear and so on\u2026<br \/>The flood of ideas is like a river flowing into the sea which is born from a small spring but never stops to get wider thanks to its tributaries.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar orientation=&#8221;right&#8221; area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_9&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Click Image&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;|700|||||||&#8221; header_text_align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_7&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Understanding&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; width=&#8221;99.2%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;|26px||||&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_font_size=&#8221;10px&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#d3d3d3&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;10px|10px|10px|10px|false|false&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Importante Note<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have done our best to provide you with the most accurate translation of our french website.
