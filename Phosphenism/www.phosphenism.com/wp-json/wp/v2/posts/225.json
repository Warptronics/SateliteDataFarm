text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221;]During a workshop, I was sitting in the middle of two rows of persons who were practicing rhythmo-phosphenic exercises in alternation. Suddenly, I found myself in the cosmos with the sensation that I was a point of light in the center of the universe with an expanded consciousness.\u2028I then understood that I was constantly united to the entire creation.\u2028Thanks to Dr\u00a0Lefebure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Alain L. G.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>We were in a phosphenic telepathy workshop, and there was an odd number of persons. I asked Mr Stiennon if I could work with him because I was without a partner. He accepted and I placed myself facing him. We were seated on chairs facing one another. In this workshop, I was the receiver and he was the transmitter. I had barely put on the eye-band and closed my eyes when I felt a very strong vibration throughout my entire physical body, or my etheric body, it was hard to tell which. I really do not know how to describe what happened. But what I can say is that it was really very powerful.\u2028Then I found myself floating above my body, and from above I could see myself sitting on the chair. An instant later, I found myself in the sky, swept up in a swirling movement. The sensations and perceptions were much clearer and stronger than those obtained using the rotating seat used to produce a gyrophene. The users of the Phosphenic Machine will understand what I am talking about. It was really very impressive. One very big thank you Mr Stiennon for this unforgettable moment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Patricia D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I have participated in numerous training courses in the domain of personal fulfilment and spiritual development, but I have to admit that the Phosphenism training course I participated in is one of the best I have ever taken part in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>P. L. R.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I had a very pleasant stay in this location where the training course was located, far from the excitement of modern day life. The courses took place in a very nice atmosphere. I was able to learn to use phosphenes thanks to the numerous exercises proposed. And I am now leaving filled with a new energy, completely rested, and my \u201fhead\u201d free from cares! A really pleasant sensation. With this method, I have finally found the most powerful tool for personal fulfilment. I am convinced of it!!! Thanks to all, without forgetting Na\u00efma and Alain for their great kindness and availability.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Sonia<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I have spent a pleasant week. Na\u00efma and Alain are very welcoming persons and extremely efficient. They are there to take care of the smallest problems of a practical nature. As for Daniel and Gilles, it was a pleasure to meet you. You are fascinating persons and you have the gift of being able to pass on your passion for Phosphenism, especially for me as a beginner. In this harbour of peace I found a well of knowledge. If you wish to experience a moment rich in emotion and sharing, you should turn to Phosphenism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Michel L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>It is so pleasant to work surrounded by nature. I cannot say what I was most enthused by. I shall need many days to completely assimilate, digest everything. Gilles \u2013 quite amazing from the start, unconventional, spontaneous and authentic \u2013 knows very well how to get the messages to pass. I like his educational teaching centered on practical applications. As I am not intellectual, it suited me and it was easy for me to follow.\u2028Four transmitters turned around me, in rhythm, stamping on the ground with their feet. The rotation was done in a counter-clockwise direction. Suddenly, I found myself transported to an Amerindian tribe. This dance turning in a circle and stamping on a rhythm of 2\u00a0seconds is \u201fbig medicine\u201d. Done in a clockwise direction, it cures the hot diseases; in the opposite direction, it cures cold diseases. I lived in this tribe and I was initiated into these curative dances by the \u201fGrandfather\u201d shaman and the whole tribe. I also liked the experience with the totem-animals very much. Gilles has a heart of gold and a true respect for nature and humanity. It is important to have teachers whose energies allow us to evolve.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Veronique M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>Thank you Daniel, Na\u00efma, Gilles and Alain for your warm and attentive welcome. Thank you for letting us live this experience. My congratulations on the quality of the meals. The training course with Gilles gave me the opportunity to live through the experience of Prometheus (which I did not previously know)! \u2026 \u2026 I feel rebalanced, and naturally, I hope to participate in other \u201fadventures\u201d. My only regret is that I did not discover Phosphenism sooner.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Fabien L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I greatly appreciated the energies of Bruno, who knew how to create a particularly warm atmosphere. During this training course, I learned an enormous amount about the rhythms. I sensed a great respect for individual differences, which allows me to continue to practice with a rather subtle palette of exercises.\u2028I appreciated the persons who trained the group. It has been very enriching. As for the infrastructure, thank you, Daniel, for allowing all of this to exist.\u2028Congratulations to Youssef and Hamza for their mastery in the preparation and serving of the meals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Therese<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>A wealth of experiences outside, using \u201fsolar\u201d phosphenes which I appreciated very much. The work done in a group, in particular using mantras, was an intense moment. I also greatly appreciated the use of rhythmic music with phosphenes which was an experience approaching a form of \u201finitiatory trance\u201d. The night-session was also very enjoyable, as well as the exercises for stimulating the awareness of intellectual rhythms. The pneumophene, which I had forgotten a bit since last year, seems to be one of the indispensable complementary tools for me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Serge F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I was very happy to camp, and also very happy to make the acquaintance of our teacher Gilles, who allowed me to discover his druidic culture, as well as his good temper. The food was very good. This stay was like a holiday and it allowed me to recharge my batteries. And especially, it permitted me to meet other participants who nearly all had riches of knowledge and with whom I exchanged multitudes of information. Concerning the workshops, it was very pleasant to participate in them outside, in nature. When I arrived, I had very little practice in Phosphenism. I would like to do exercises daily at home so as to continue the work that we did. I had some beautiful experiences, and beautiful dreams that allowed me to understand certain things about myself. A big thank you to Gilles, Alain, Na\u00efma and Daniel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Pascal C.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>Pleasant atmosphere. Very good quality of the participants in the training course, and the energy generated from the very first day completely boosted my energy.\u2028The most striking experience: I found myself with an extremely strong sensation at the level of the hara (\u4e39\u7530 d\u0101nti\u00e1n (hypogastria) in Chinese, hara ou seika tanden in Japanese), and in my spine (nerve centres) as if I were in an egg. I was transformed into a four-legged animal \u2026 And that is really something. Thanks to Gilles for this very beautiful experience and all the others. Thank you Daniel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Monique K.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I am very happy and satisfied to have been able to participate in the Phosphenism Advanced Training Course. It is quite feasible to practice Phosphenism by oneself, using the books and CDs by Dr\u00a0Lefebure and Daniel Stiennon as a base for study. Practice done with other persons at a given time, accelerates the results. The greater the number of persons practicing together, the more powerful it is. And also, attending a Phosphenism training course allows one to verify that the exercises are practiced correctly.\u2028For example, yesterday I learned how to practice the powerful exercise of eye convergence correctly. I realized that I was not doing it the right way. I learned how to correct it and how to practice in an optimal way. One of the other benefits of this type of training course is an accelerated accumulation of rhythms. When you have 25\u00a0persons who project a rhythm of 1\/6th of second on you, it is very powerful! And in addition, when Daniel Stiennon is among one of these persons and along with other very experienced Phosphenists, it increases the quality and the quantity of the rhythms that are transmitted even more. Having explained this, I was literally transported within myself by a powerful wave of energy. This type of exercise particularly allows one to gain time in months of practice, hence the great interest. For my part, it was after participating in a Phosphenism training course (the Basic Training Course) that I began practicing phosphenic techniques in a serious and regular manner.\u2028This Advanced Training Course brought me a great amount of energy and enthusiasm; it allowed me to commit myself completely to following this path.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Franck<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>In spite of the exercises proposed, I spent the entire training course thinking only of the text written on Atlantis by Daniel STIENNON. A bit like an obsessive thought having for a backdrop \u201fand what if Atlantis was a place hidden in our universe of dreams?\u201d Two weeks after the training course, my efforts were rewarded. I spent the night visiting a city swallowed up by the sea. I was able to go from one place to another without having to inhale air, like a fish in the depths. I visited temples and buildings covered with coral and seaweed. I entered a building, whose age and period of construction I would be incapable of estimating, and I saw an altar where a flame was burning. I felt enticed by it, drawn towards the flame. The feeling inspired in me was very strong and I did not dare to go any further in the experience. I am going to start doing the lateral sway exercises again in order to strengthen myself and diminish my feelings of apprehension. Following this experience, I have the strong feeling that indeed all things are within us, and that \u201fif you knock on the door, it will be opened\u201d. Do the Phosphenic exercises and you will discover the universe that is within.\u2028An immense thank you to Phosphenism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Bernard F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>Regarding the organization, the infrastructure of the campsite and the meals, I think that everybody is unanimous in saying that it is perfect. Absolutely nothing to criticize. I appreciated the meals composed of slow-burning sugars at noon, like those adapted for sportsmen. They provided the energy necessary for undertaking all the afternoon exercises as well as the evening ones.\u2028I had three professors who had three different styles. Bruno, very pedagogical, is ideal for someone who is a novice. Gilles, who offers an approach to Phosphenism in close relation to nature and the elements comprising it. His training course (Naturo-Phosphenology) is one to discover because he opens another dimension to us. And finally, Daniel STIENNON, who proposes an intensive course, if not to say Spartan, starting from the postulate that it is necessary to practice a great deal of rhythmic thinking (rhythmo-phosphenism) to obtain grandiose results.\u2028I appreciated the three personalities, and especially Daniel STIENNON, because I feel without a doubt that only extensive practice with a bare minimum of explanations is the key that leads to experiences. Moreover, as he himself says: \u201fIn my training courses, I do not really appreciate those persons who come because they saw the light; there is enough information on the web site so that each person can understand the legitimacy of the works of Dr\u00a0LEFEBURE without having to add to it. Living oneself an experience is the first thing that one should seek. But in our intellectualized world, we prefer above all bookish and intellectual knowledge.\u201d\u2028The intensive workshops allowed me to make my energy double denser, and this helps me to obtain more lucidity during sleep. On this matter, I completely share Daniel\u2019s opinion on the notion of the lost paradise. I do think that the world of the sleep (the nocturnal world) can be incredibly rich in perceptions of all kinds. Finding oneself completely awake and conscious in a grandiose environment with ecstatic feelings, in a known or unknown environment, can only recall Genesis in Eden.\u2028Each out of body experience, or astral travelling, can only strengthen our glorious body and allow us to anticipate what life after life could be, or at least this is what I think. The plunge into this universe of perceptions and sensations, beyond the pure sensation of the physical senses, is really an experience to be discovered. I am limited by the expression of this in words and I am unable to give a more precise description. And is it really useful after all?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Claude L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>Extraordinary to feel my forearms penetrate into the trunk of the tree.\u2028Sitting with my back against a tree, the extraordinary feeling of being the master of the place, drawn into the tree with a maternal sweetness.\u2028The extraordinary feeling coming from the ash tree which communicated its ill-being or its disease or other things. And the next day it appeared before me, asking me for help.\u2028The extraordinary sensation of sinking into the ground to become almost one with the earth.\u2028It was extraordinary to see through the eyes of a bear, to look at my snout and see my tongue licking my chops, watch a deer heading towards the forest, being followed by another four-legged animal, and then to see a bird of prey with a hooked beak and its claws getting ready to perch. Strangely, at the same moment Gilles pointed out to us that an eagle owl had perched above our heads and was watching us during the exercises.\u2028With a piercing glance over the savannah, it was extraordinary to watch a herd of animals go by at full gallop.\u2028These were the important moments in this training course. Difficult to forget them, they are engraved in my memory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Gilbert L. G.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>Before my arrival, I felt tired because of the multitude of daily, family and professional obligations; I really did not think I was in the best form for following a training course. But from the first morning, the exercises done in a group reactivated my energy and I was really able to enter into the experiences of each exercise with ease.\u2028I am leaving in top form, rested and relaxed with many rhythms in my visual chaos. Thank you once again to Daniel, Na\u00efma, Gilles, Alain, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and to all of our friends from the training course.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Charles R.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>During the training courses, I found peace and the mental calmness, and then I managed to see the internal light which, in my case, is an illumination of very yellow color and which permitted me to achieve the state of NIRVANA.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean P.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I must thank all the members of the Phosphenism team who I had not previously met, even though I have been practicing the method for ten years.\u2028A particular thanks to Daniel for having preserved the works of Doctor LEFEBURE, with so many sacrifices on his part. Without his doggedness for spreading the method, I would have never come across it. And I would never have become the person that I am today. Phosphenism has developed my perception and my well-being in a rather extraordinary way, and yet it is far from being finished. It has allowed me find the path which I now consider to be mine.\u2028Thank you also to Gilles for all his explanations concerning initiation and nature, Na\u00efma for her good cooking and Alain who was always available and helpful.\u2028This training course has allowed me to revise my method of functioning, develop further my techniques and discover new ones which should help me to make enormous progress.\u2028A mass of experiences for the moment and a certainty concerning the rhythms created and many answers to my questions concerning my inability to let go.\u2028I had a very good stay, we were well-received, the place was very calm, the showers and sanitary facilities were irreproachable, the food delicious, in brief no problem whatsoever. It was a very pleasant stay with a continuity that will be just as surprising regarding the incubation of the rhythms that were created in my double and which will continue to expand into small or large forms of experiences once I have returned to my everyday life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Fran\u00e7ois B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>A very warm reception at the campsite and in the school. Daniel put us at ease right away. It also was a great privilege to spend these first days with him as an instructor.\u2028This training course was enriching: for the exercises that I did not previously know and equally for the rhythms which Daniel and Gilles introduced me to along with the other members of the group. I thus leave recharged in energy and full of rhythms that I will hopefully be able to maintain and multiply tenfold through daily and regular practice \u2013 and even more than before \u2013 on a solid basis.\u2028Not so easy to let go, but it is just that. Contrary to all expectations, I was able to live through experiences where I least expected to find them. I was lying in wait for \u201fmy double\u201d a bit too much!\u2028I hope that we shall have the opportunity to meet again for a training course of force +++ or maybe one in the stars \u2026 Thanks to all the team, and particularly to Daniel and to Gilles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Virginie P.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I appreciated this big family that we formed.

The thing I loved was that he allowed me become conscious once again that Nature is as much alive as we are and it deserves respect.\u2028I also appreciated his enthusiasm in taking us towards the doors of the unknown and in helping us go beyond our limits.\u2028Today, I leave with another way of looking at life and with the idea that Humanity will be enlightened by the light of the phosphene.\u2028The world and its beings bear this light and they have always carried it, even if it was hidden in darkness for centuries, or even millenniums. It will come back only more powerful, more brilliant and the beings in this light will then be \u201filluminated\u201d, projected into \u201fthe next world\u201d.

It makes me want to discover Phosphenism even more and to further my experiences in this domain.\u2028The approach using Nature and Shamanism is what I can relate to the most, even though I liked Bruno\u2019s teaching very much. The training course is very rich; we assimilated a great amount of information and knowledge.\u2028In the \u201fContinuing Training course\u201d, I think that the fact that we remained in the same place for eating and sleeping is essential: not only for setting and keeping energetic dynamics, but also for the human relationships that are established.\u2028I had encounters here that were enriching and interesting and even beyond that. It is a magnificent example of openness and human relationships.\u2028The welcome that we received from everyone (Daniel, Bruno, Gilles, Youssef and Hamza) was very warm and pleasant.

I feel much closer to nature\u2019s elements. I have always been fascinated by the beauty of Nature. Through Phosphenism, I am happy to have learned some exercises which unite me with Nature. I think that as much as possible, we should follow a continuous training course with each professor because Phosphenism is such a huge universe and the exercises can be infinite. Each professor has a different approach and a unique style of teaching. Gilles Gablain has a very strong personality, a strong character; every anecdote is told with such enthusiasm, such energy that we are immediately transported with him in the adventure.\u2028I am happy at the idea of going to Paris soon to meet the other instructors.\u2028I didn\u2019t have the slightest experience, but I am not at all disappointed: that it will come later. For me, the important thing is to have understood the exercises and the essence of Phosphenism. I thank Daniel for his kindness and his presence. Gilles and Bruno are incredible, but you should come and meet them.

It is a tool that allows one to work alone or in group, keeping in mind that this is done in a structured manner.\u2028I had the pleasure of meeting people here who, like myself, love Life and respect it.\u2028Finally, the organization in the areas of transportation, accommodation, schedules and the instructors is very acceptable and completely satisfied me.\u2028Ever yours.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Marie F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I am very happy to have made the acquaintance of Gilles.

This training course corresponded to what I had come to learn and experience (working with the lamp and the sun, experimenting with the sways and breathing).\u2028The training course in Naturophosphenism or Light Shamanism leaves me perplexed.

And so, I rediscovered the rhythms of the 9th symphony of Beethoven and those of many other recent groups.\u2028I keep in memory the exceptional image of a moment of pure happiness shared together: a long series of OM in the setting sun, at the foot of a majestic oak which opened its big branches to share its energy with us. A moment of love, a total communion with nature.\u2028Thanks to you, Bruno, for having let us live such moments. Thanks to you, Daniel, for organizing all this with efficiency.

First of all, because it was a training course in residence, and also I had been dreaming of doing this for a long time. On this point, I was not disappointed! The location was magnificent, the camping area was perfect for getting to know the other participants and exchanging points of view, the organization was flawless\u2026 In my mind and for the pleasure of the eyes: I can still see Daniel\u2019s personal fitness room which is at the same time private and in the middle of nature, and the simple pleasures of the senses whether it be the full moon, the cicadas singing in the forest or the conviviality of the meals.\u2028To all this, add the quality of the teaching, the participants and the magic of phosphenic energy.\u2028For me this was \u201fgoing back to school\u201d after many years of wandering. I appreciated the clarity of the explanations, the efficiency of the progress made and the moments of laughter and good humor. I feel a bit nostalgic and would love to return.\u2028Thank you Daniel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Therese D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>The conditions of accommodation were excellent.\u2028The camping area and the sanitary facilities were very clean.\u2028We had hot water at all times; there were three showers and a sink.\u2028The food cooked by Isabelle was very good.\u2028In short, the organization was perfect in all aspects.\u2028The training course: One evening Gilles had us observe the moon and the stars.\u2028The object was to focus on a star and try to reproduce \u201fthe dance of the sun\u201d.\u2028And, in effect, a number of observers saw their star shake and rotate on its axis.\u2028The day after, I personally had the chance of experiencing a wonderful voyage after a meal. I had gone to lie down on the floor in the classroom to take advantage of the coolness. After several minutes of meditation, I suddenly found myself surrounded by stars in a setting identical to the one I had seen the night before, and with a remarkable clearness. This phenomenon did not last very long, but it lasted long enough to fill me with happiness. I was still under the spell when, a few minutes later, I found myself once again in the middle of the stars. I was certainly aided by the high concentration of phosphenic salts accumulated in the classroom. This is probably what triggered the phenomenon. What bliss\u2026\u2028During the training course, other persons experienced very intense moments.\u2028One person made contact with his spiritual guide during the final exercise in naturo-phosphenism.\u2028Some of our Spanish friends had very powerful emotional experiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Alain R.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>I would like stress the fact that these courses are very clear and precise, and accessible to everyone. Roland explained the different techniques to us using the appropriate words; he passed his knowledge on to us along with his enthusiasm for Phosphenism. Throughout the entire workshop, along with the other participants I felt calmness and serenity in a pleasant setting. The presence of this energy, a marvelous sensation, and this amazing yellow rotating seat that created the sensations of my energy double. The use of the Alternophone is also remarkable and produces a very pleasant sensation of calmness.\u2028The efficiency of all these techniques was multiplied tenfold by the group effect.\u2028Everything is very well set up, from Isabelle\u2019s delicious food to Daniel and Stephane\u2019s flawless organization.

I do not need to go back over the basic techniques that were very accessible to everyone.\u2028During this training session, Ahoura enabled us to feel the transmission of energy from one person to another or from the group to the individual. The sensations were clearly felt by most of the group. These sensations were often very pleasant and nearly \u201fmagical\u201d. Roland also taught us how to be in touch with our very rich subjective world.<br \/>\nA message for newcomers:. I am not \u201flunatic\u201d, I am 42\u00a0years old, I have a family, a Doctorate, I earn a good living and I am very happy. I do not practice Phosphenism to escape from reality. I practice on a daily basis because I can feel the benefits it brings: inner joy, confidence, the development of an inner sensitivity and an understanding of religions and traditions \u201ffrom the inside\u201d.\u2028If, like me, this program interests you: study and practice Phosphenism, it is simply thrilling! Follow a training course, as practicing with a group is essential for multiplying the sensations tenfold and for progressing on the marvelous path of self-discovery.\u2028Thanks once again to everyone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Lionel G.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>Well done Daniel and Gilles!\u2028For these three days of initiation, I confer you the title of excellence.\u2028I am going to buy a hammock, a rocking chair and a rotating chair.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Thierry T.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>If you are thinking of attending a training course, you can come with your mind at ease.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Elisabeth M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>Very well organized training course where I learned so many things.\u2028For me, the exercises practiced in a group with certain persons as transmitters triggered very powerful rhythms, and generated vortices and explosions of light.

This training course completely satisfied me. The pace of the sessions was steady, the courses were in depth and our instructor \u201fGilles\u201d was passionate and competent.\u2028I also appreciated the atmosphere, sleeping in tents, the hot showers, the sanitary facilities which were always clean. I strongly advise attending this type of training course, to discover new possibilities for the practice of the exercises. Nevertheless, the seminar requires a certain amount of motivation, as it includes a large amount of practice.\u2028I had the following experiences during the training course: a sensation of the sacred, of being in a mystical place. I was able to sense my first chakra very strongly, then the other ones, a sensation of radiating light leading to the sacred. I passed through a symbol similar to a \u201fstained-glass window\u201d and felt as if I was flying upwards like a bird. I passed through geometrical symbols, rising up towards the sky.

I also felt it on my etheric double as well as on those of the participants near me, accompanied by the sensation that my arms were levitating.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Pierre D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>A bath of phosphenic rejuvenation where the relationship established with the elements of nature strongly contributes to comprehension and takes our practice of phosphenism to a higher octave, much hoped for and marvelously encountered during this course. The organization was flawless and the eloquence of the teachers incites me to renew these etheric encounters that are so beautiful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Yves D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#49ba23\" \/>\n<p>This training course took place in a calm and natural setting, away from the worries of modern life, in meditation and good humor with people from all backgrounds. Roland taught us the practical applications of many techniques, in harmony with nature around us. This has enabled me to become conscious of the different rhythms and energies around us and within us and to broaden my mind. These experiences have helped me put aside the fears and prejudices that blocked my spiritual evolution. Working in a group allows one to obtain results more quickly than working alone or using a book. The precise guidelines and the explanations provided by Roland gave a real dimension to these experiences. I was able to feel my energy, as well as the energy of the other participants. I saw a magnificent little white elf, regained confidence and found fulfillment.\u2028Thanks to Roland, Daniel and all the participants for these magical moments, the exchanges of points of view and the good atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Nathalie L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;1_3,1_3,1_3&#8243;
