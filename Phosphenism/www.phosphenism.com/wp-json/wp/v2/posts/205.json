Sometimes I can also make out the outlines of surrounding objects. Once, it was so striking that I had to touch my eyes to make sure they were properly closed; what was the case.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Geoffrey M.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>The evening in the darkness, I perceive many luminous points on the surface of my body \u2026 a kind of energy which circulates on the surface of it. This experience gives me the will to continue and deepen this observation. It reinforces my self-confidence and my motivation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Claude J.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>One day in the early morning around 6:45 am, in a half-sleep, I had a flash of light about 2 meters away from me while I was in bed. There was then a formation of a phosphene. It was as if my mind invited this phosphene to come and incarnate in me. Then I saw my brain like floating in the air in the place where this phosphene had formed. There were dark spots in my brain in places. These spots disappeared one after the other under the effect of the phosphene resulting from the flash of light with which this experiment began. In the end, my brain was uniformly bright and luminous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean Enokou K.

Perhaps this is due to the fact that the point of focus or consciousness of my mind has acquired the habit of focusing in depth rather than in \u201fvolume\u201d. Before, I used to see a grayish cloud. Now, I see the rays shining and the structure of the colors (aura).\u2028I would like to point out the aspect of extreme power and the efficiency of these exercises and I would like to thank you once again for continuing to keep the flame alive. In these troubled times, one can still ask the question when will the \u201fhundredth monkey\u201d make its appearance\u2026 May there be all the necessary \u201fsynchronicity\u201d to ensure the expansion and survival of this method.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Yannik (Switzerland)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>My first experience occurred just one week after my first workshop (basic formation). During that week, I had practiced three to four hours of exercises per day. My sessions were composed primarily of sways and rotations. No convergences, nor static tensions, etc.<br \/>\nAt that time, a friend of mine who did not know anything about my research in this domain was staying at my house. It is important to mention this detail. While I was asleep, I gradually to realized that my body began to vibrate\u2026 A hardly perceptible sensation of vibrations that then became increased in intensity little by little and extended slightly beyond my body. I let myself be carried along by these vibrations that grew more and more powerful. It was as if I were carried by a current made of multiple tiny waves. It was wonderful, intense and very pleasant\u2026 almost intoxicating. I then decided to focus on a detail of my visual chaos with the idea of trying to see as far as possible\u2026 Suddenly, and even a bit brutally, a large intense and blinding white light filled my field of vision. This vision was so real that for a moment I thought my friend had got up and turned the light in the bedroom on. I sat up suddenly and was going to reprimand him. What a mistake! The room was totally dark.\u2028What did I miss that night? This vision has never reoccurred\u2026\u2028As I type these last words, I must admit that in the face of this question I feel a somewhat bitter and there is a certain nostalgia about that moment.\u2028In any case, many thanks to Daniel, and I invite all the phosphenists to sit down in front of their keyboards and recount their experiences. For my part, there is no hesitation to do so.\u2028Make us dream!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Guillaume P.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I have started to study your method with my brother-in-law, as soon as I received your book. After a certain time, we started to get some results.\u2028On many occasions, I saw \u201fthe light\u201d. That expression, that I considered purely symbolic, is actually the only one that is right to describe the phenomenon: I thought that the sun was flooding the room or that there was a fire\u2026 or that the lights were on. I opened my eyes\u2026 it was dark. Though I knew about the phenomenon, I was caught many times.\u2028Later, lying on my bed awake, I was practicing the exercise of ocular convergence. I saw a kind of a hole, a large niche or recess. It was partly closed by a veil hanging on two columns, behind which there was a bright light. The symbol was magnificent.\u2028Later, while I was practicing convergence with my eyes straight, I saw a pair of eyes looking at me fixedly and then converging upwards. I quickly did the same.\u2028I have, since, had two out-of-body experiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Marcel-Mario F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I often read in bed, for half an hour to an hour. Sometimes (the phenomenon still occurs once in a while) after putting my book away, switching the light off and then partly hiding under the blanket (so that no light can reach me) and after maintaining my concentration for 5 to 10 minutes, I can see my hands glowing. I can distinctly see the outline of my fingers and also the folds of the fabric, inside the \u201fnest\u201d in which my head is resting. That phenomenon takes place with my eyes open. Sometimes, the light is so bright that I believe I could read a book, if the print is not too small, though I must say that I have never tried it.\u2028I have always wondered what was the cause of that phenomenon (the glowing hands) and it is only after reading the passage of your book about Mixing and the phosphenes that I realized that I had probably done a phosphene while I was reading, caused by the reflection of the light on the pages of the book. It is thanks to that phosphene that I have been able to perceive my hands and the folds in the fabric of the sheets, with my head hidden under them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Leon V. D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I have developed clairvoyance thanks to the techniques of astral projection with the perception of locations, characters and historical situations (that I have verified through research). These experiences have often been directed towards a particular country, a fact that has allowed me to meet great people! They remain engraved in my memory and have provided me with a different outlook on life. I have been able to perceive the past through the medium of historical objects.\u2028I have had contacts with my guide. The amount of things I have discovered in just a year thanks to Phosphenism is amazing. The potential of what could be done is baffling.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Dominique P.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I did a phosphene and saw the image of my brother appear, though I was not thinking about him at the time. I saw him in his bedroom, getting up. Certain objects had disappeared from the room, others had simply changed place.\u2028The phosphene lasted about 30 seconds. It had the diameter of a 5 francs coin (the equivalent of a dollar coin) but I would have been able to distinguish tiny details within it, such as a fly settled on my brother\u2019s cheek.\u2028When the vision ended, I checked what time it was. It was precisely 7 am.\u2028As soon as I got out of bed, I wrote to my brother to ask him if he was awake at 7 o\u2019clock on that day, though it did not seem probable to me as I know he has the habit of going to bed very late and also getting up late, at around 10 o\u2019clock.<br \/>\nHe answered back: \u201fWell yes, it is true, I have been getting up at 7 for the past few days\u2026 I go to bed earlier\u2026 I prefer it like that\u2026\u201d I had not mentioned all the details of the vision; I had only asked him if he had moved his large cupboard, as I had seen, in its place, just a simple set of shelves. He answered that nothing had been moved, nor added, nor removed. I thought to myself: \u201fMy vision was not perfectly right\u201d.<br \/>\nA few months later, I went to La Rochelle for three days and I visited my brother\u2019s room. What an incredible surprise! All the details of my vision were perfectly right! My brother had simply forgotten to tell me that he had, for a long time now, changed the position of his bed. That is why, from the angle of vision the phosphene was offering me, I saw the left wall instead of the right wall. My vision was actually right, it actually had an amazing precision.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Louis R.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>Here is what happened to me during the course of continuous formation.\u2028Exercise on the visual chaos: during the blue phase of the phosphene, I see a pyramid rotating around its vertical axis. I only perceive its edges, but very distinctly. They seem luminous (like neon lights seen from afar). They are of a yellow color. The image then fades, then another pyramid that seem to be made of crystal appears over a pink background dotted with a multitude of small pink circles. It is orientated horizontally. I try to focus on a detail and luminous diagrams appear. I can see dark blue, green and pink. The exercise ends a short while later.\u2028Later during the course\u2026 an exercise of projection of the visual chaos. I am working with a colleague, I wait until the phosphene almost completely disappears before I start the exercise. I project my visual chaos on her face, while I imagine a mental rhythm, like a pulsation. Suddenly, I think about the megaliths of Stonehenge, in England, and I try to visualize them moving rhythmically in my visual chaos. At the end of the exercise, we exchange our impressions and my colleague mentions that she perceived the image of a very hard stone, hitting the back of her head regularly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Christian B.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>During the course of continuous formation, we did a workshop on clairvoyance. Two persons were transmitting energy to a third. The first one was focusing his thought on the third eye of the receiver, the second one on the back of his head. The receiver was concentrating on his visual chaos. When the phosphene disappeared, it was replaced by the diffuse glow, milky white in color. It appeared progressively.\u2028The point of concentration, akin to a bulb in the middle of the phosphene, remained and endured like a luminous pearl. The tension focused on that point penetrated inside to unravel new, deeper zones and was again replaced by the point of concentration. The progression was similar to the progression of consciousness towards the center of a gaseous nebula. On both sides, patches of luminous mist advanced. At a certain moment, the vapors disappeared, giving way to very thin, concentric silver rings popping up from the chaos in a pseudo periodical manner. In the center, the point of concentration rotated, more and more luminous. Orbiting around it, I perceived a smaller red dot. It made me think of a double star.\u2028During an other exercise, I had a similar type of experience, my visual chaos opened up and I saw the gigantic extension of a spiral galaxy seen from the side, with an inclination of 45\u00b0. It was but a very brief vision, though it seemed very real.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Romuald S.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>An experience that took place while I was doing exercises of square breathing.\u2028I lost control of my body and felt a sensation of paralysis in my neck, then shivers throughout my body, accentuating into a formidable energy. My body was run through by a sensation of total irradiation, coming from the bottom of my legs. It reminded me of orgasm, though it was more intense and it was accompanied by a scent of flowers. When its intensity reached its peak, I concentrated on a point of my body, an action that suddenly released the energy within me. At that moment, I saw a great white light that filled the room.\u2028Then, I remained there, laying down, floating in a sensation of well-being.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Roger D.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>During a workshop, I have visualized a small 3D pyramid. It seemed made of the same color green as the phosphene, as if it was a diffuse matter that had densified by concentrating itself in a restricted space. The pyramid of green light had a very intense presence and rotated on its axis. It was very unusual, and it only took place once.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Alain<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I have had the chance to observe a phenomenon that deserves to be recounted. Last night, when I went to bed, I was next to my girlfriend, holding her hand while practicing the exercise of concentration on the visual chaos (I had already been able to notice that it was possible to transmit the sensations related to energy).\u2028At a certain moment, she told me that she was observing greenish, pulsating lights, stemming from the outer part of her visual chaos and concentrating in its center, acquiring different colors in the process. I then continued practicing the exercise without telling her about my impressions, not even about the simple fact that I was practicing an exercise. A bit later, she mentioned that the luminous sensation had faded. I asked her to sit with her back facing me and I placed my hands on her head. I did not really know how to proceed so I imagined a current of sparks running along my arms and flowing rhythmically (every 2 seconds) through her. As I did not obtain appreciable results, I started to practice purely mental static tensions accompanied by the mantra \u201fkikiki\u201d at the speed of 1\/6th of a second. Every time I would get a strong sensation, I would release a \u201fcharge\u201d in her (when I was feeling a characteristic sensation of shivering). The luminous projections in her field of vision resumed almost instantly and only stopped 5 or 6 minutes later.\u2028Another remarkable fact: she told me that she perceived \u201fmeteorites\u201d moving very fast towards her. Again, one can only admit how easy it is to transmit phosphenic phenomena\u2026 as well as the importance of static tensions! I can only admit that it is not my favorite exercise after a day\u2019s work. Having said that, I never observe as much activity in my etheric body as when I practice that exercise. It seems imperative to practice it if one wishes to produce out-of-body experiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Yannick<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I often have kaleidoscopic visions with sounds and images accompanied by a mental and physical paralysis. It is scary in the beginning, but at the same time, it is very pleasant and one feels protected. I also experience many inner flashes and my thoughts acquire much speed and flow like water or wind. I often dream that I am flying with, sometimes, the impression that I am really falling. But, what is most surprising is that, in my dreams, I can zoom in and out, like if I had a camera. Thanks to Daniel and Dr Lefebure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Jean-Pierre<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I was woken up by the tinkling of a bell. Sitting on my bed, a soft light was flooding the room. The sound of the bell was resonating in my head. On each side of the bed, there were persons who were holding my hand. I could not see their faces. A third person was standing at the bed head and had his hand on my left shoulder. Then from my solar plexus, a ball of light, golden yellow in color, started to grow like a inflatable balloon, filling the entire room.\u2028The bell sound stopped. The characters disappeared and the ball of light faded as well as the light that filled the room. Everything went back to normal and I fell asleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Alexandra F.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>When I practice the head sways and when I observe the visual chaos (after a quarter of an hour) there is a luminous patch of purple color (intense and captivating) that appears slowly. If I am doing a phosphene, the patch can engulf it. That purple color is so intense that the greenish yellow color of the phosphene is barely visible . When I observe the details of that purple patch, I am able to notice that it is whirling on itself a little bit like a whirlpool. In the beginning of my training, I could see (unknown) faces inside. There is also another phenomenon that takes place when I practice head sways (with the phosphene or the purple patch): I perceive luminous \u201fwaves\u201d (purple or greenish-yellow) that come from behind my eyes and seem to \u201fmaintain or nourish\u201d the phosphene or the purple patch.

At the end of the circle, a small explosion of luminous patches takes place in the center, like fireworks.\u2028That experience lasted for at least a few minutes.\u2028Then a multitude of experiences, astral projections, visual chaos, conscious voyage in memories that function like lucid dreams, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Philippe L.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I dreamed of Daniel Stiennon last night, and there was someone else with him. Daniel took some papers and gave them to the other person, saying:\u2028\u201d There you are, as my master passed on his knowledge and his teaching to me, it\u2019s my turn to pass on my knowledge to you, and as a my spiritual son, it is for you to continue my work and to guide people with the light. \u201d And then I saw a triangular light whose top was down and approached me. This triangle was in front of me but I had the feeling that it was absorbing me, everything around me turned white, and it was so bright that I woke up. I opened my eyes, it was still dark, but I still saw several forms of light, I thought I was dreaming but I had my eyes open and I saw the time, it was 3:04 am . You know when we close our eyes and reopen them, we see sparks of light, It was the same but I didn\u2019t have to close my eyes to see them, and it was even stronger and brighter. White and blue light and a little green. It continued like that between 5 and 10 minutes, before I went back to sleep. Thanks Daniel !<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Youssef (Morocco)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" color=\"#a5a5a5\" \/>\n<p>I am outside my apartment, in my vegetable garden, around 3:30 p.m. The sky is covered.\u2028For a period of 30 to 40 minutes, I experienced a visual sensation similar to what Dr LEFEBURE describes on page 47 of VOLUME I \u201d INITIATIVE EXPERIENCES \u2013 THE SENSORY WAY \u201d Ed. 1976: \u201c\u2026 the light conquered during the he ocular convergence exercise floods the follower all day long during work or rest, whether in twilight, darkness or the sun. This light, which is not imaginative, gives an intense feeling of reality, and yet it is not physical. \u201c For my part, I experienced a very strong concentration of a very intense\u201c lemon-yellow \u201dcolor. She was very concentrated, in areas, under the eyelids and nose. The whole face was concerned and illuminated. To convince myself that I was not the victim of an illusion, I bit my lips several times and pinched my cheeks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><strong>Georges<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_testimonial][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;1_3,1_3,1_3&#8243;
