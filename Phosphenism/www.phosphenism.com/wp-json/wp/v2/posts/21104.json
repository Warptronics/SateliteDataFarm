The relaxing effect can be felt immediately. To deepen the effect of profound relaxation and the state of modified consciousness, I use the seven colors of the rainbow. I ask the patient to visualize the various lights, starting with the red light, all the way up to the purple light. The patient imagines that his\/her body is full of light and radiates the corresponding color (red, orange\u2026) while mixing each color of light with a specific sentence:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Red light:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0I feel alive, dynamic and in good health;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>Orange light:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0I feel harmonious and radiate a warm communion and benevolence in my relations;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"><strong>Yellow light:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0I am awake, spontaneous and creative;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong>Green light:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0I respect life and nature;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Blue light:\u00a0<\/strong><\/span>I am calm and perfectly peaceful;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\"><strong>Indigo light:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0I am serene and I am overrun by mystical joy;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong>Purple light:<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0I am calm and serene, I feel connected to the positive energy of the entire universe.<br \/>Finally, the patient finishes the session with the star phosphene: i.e. the patient looks at the light bulb while moving his\/her eyes up, down, right, left, and diagonally, passing by the center.\u00a0<strong>The patient then feels transformed and perceives several options for solving his\/her problems.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the end of the session, I offer a glass of alkaline, ionized water to the patient.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Developing self-confidence<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To develop self-confidence, I use Phosphenic Mixing with anteroposterior head sways with the following sentence: \u201fAs I am confident, I am me, I exist, I have rights, I express myself, I am responsible, I am powerful, I am kind.\u201d<br \/>Another example: \u201fI can direct my thoughts by telling myself that I am enjoying good results in my studies for this exam.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the patient finishes the session with the star phosphene: i.e. the patient looks at the light bulb while moving his\/her eyes up, down, right, left, and diagonally, passing by the center. Of course, I explain to the patient the meaning of the sentence he\/she has chosen and that corresponds to their current objective or to the problem they want to solve.<\/p>\n<p>For instance:\u00a0I am me\u00a0means that I have my own values, beliefs and needs to satisfy. And, it is up to me to do it, solely for myself, among the others, rather than for the others, neither against them. I am responsible for my well-being, for my actions.<\/p>\n<p><em>I am powerful<\/em>\u00a0means that I am conscious of my feelings, of my emotions, of my thoughts and that I express them in the here and now. I state what I think and I do as I say. I feel coherent and harmonious.<\/p>\n<p><em>I have rights\u00a0<\/em>means that I have the right to exist, to have needs, I have the right to express what I want to express, I take my place, I have the right to love and be loved in an unconditional manner.<\/p>\n<p>Phosphenic Mixing creates a new neurological pathway; the message is imprinted in the brain and comes into action through the idea-motivity phenomenon. During the first session, the patient immediately feels confident as if he\/she had had a \u201fchange of skin\u201d or was \u201fwearing new clothes\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The patients can practice that exercise on their own, three times a day. Once in the morning, just after waking up, it is the auspicious moment for fixing or stimulating the message; once in the evening, before sleep, to message the brain what it needs to integrate during the period of regulation; and one more time during the day so that the message becomes unconscious and automatic.<\/p>\n<p>Example: a student in psychiatry is anxious and fears that he is going to fail his exam in spite of the work he has generated to learn and revise his lessons. A single session of Phosphenic Mixing has given him \u201fthe bones of a good psychiatrist\u201d who thoroughly knows the subjects he is dealing with. The self-confidence that he has developed has helped him successfully passing his exam.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Practicing triangular or square breathing instantaneously reduces stress.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In an airport, a woman who is waiting for her flight to take off is anxious. She is chain-smoking, walking relentlessly up and down the hall, asking ceaselessly and aggressively the airline employee for the time of departure as she is scared that she is going to miss the connecting flight. She then has coffee, sitting next to me, I suggest that she should practice a bit of triangular breathing to dissipate the stress she is accumulating. She does that and, one minute later, she feels calmer, friendlier. She thanks me and we exchange interesting conversations on other subjects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A child who is described as hyperactive at school.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A mother asks me if I can give her some help treating her 8-year old son, described as an hyperactive by his teachers. He is always chatting with his schoolmates and cannot remain calm. He is restless.<br \/>I evaluate him as an intelligent boy, bright, spontaneous, a bit of a rebel.<\/p>\n<p>Je commence \u00e0 faire le phosph\u00e8ne avec lui et je lui demande de bien observer les formes et les couleurs des lumi\u00e8res qu\u2019il voit se d\u00e9rouler, les yeux band\u00e9s. Je lui demande de me faire une description \u00e0 haute voix. L\u2019exercice se fait en trois fois et dure une dizaine de minutes.<\/p>\n<p>I start by doing a phosphene with him and I ask him to observe closely the shapes and the colors of the lights that follow one another, while he is wearing a sleep mask. I ask him to describe them in a loud voice. This is a powerful game of concentration as, during the entire exercise, he is fascinated by the dance of the colors and his whole body remains still. He enjoys this game of changing colors.<br \/>Afterwards, I ask him to repeat, in a loud voice, \u201fI am calm and relaxed\u201d while he is practicing Phosphenic Mixing with anteroposterior head sways.<br \/>At the start, he repeats that sentence in a loud voice for a minute, then he repeats it mentally \u201fin his head\u201d for another minute, then again in a loud voice for the third, final minute. The exercise lasts approximately ten minutes.<\/p>\n<p>His mother is present during the session and she notices the instantaneous change in her son&#8217;s behavior. She purchases the Pocket Lamp so that her son can practice more exercises on his own.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A girl in the fourth grade cannot memorize certain mathematical laws and formulas. She gets it wrong every time. Her father, a financial director, does not manage to help her memorizing adequately.<\/p>\n<p>I start by doing a phosphene with her and then ask her to observe closely the shapes and the colors of the patches of light that appear in her field of vision, while she is wearing a sleep mask. I ask her to describe them in a loud voice. The exercise is repeated three times for a total duration of approximately ten minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Then, she writes down the formula clearly, in big letters on a sheet of paper. She recites it in a loud voice. She closes her eyes and tries to picture the written formula and repeats it in a loud voice.<\/p>\n<p>First, she focuses on the lamp for thirty seconds and then closes her eyes while reciting and placing the formula in the phosphene.<\/p>\n<p>Then, she focuses on the lamp for thirty seconds, then she reads the written formula in a loud voice, through the phosphene, using a second amp to dim its glow and be able to read through it.<\/p>\n<p>The action of the phosphene increases concentration and clarifies memorization, making it sharper, more precise. Phosphenic Mixing creates a new neurological pathway to store the information.<\/p>\n<p>She continues the exercise with the other formulas she needs to learn, following the same protocol. After the second week, her father compliments me because his daughter does not make mistakes on the mathematical laws any more and has good marks at school.<\/p>\n<p>As for me, there is no doubt: Phosphenic Mixing is an efficient method of learning, it develops self-confidence, concentration, memorization, helps recovering regular sleep patterns and favors healing.<\/p>\n<p>Every night, before I go to bed and every morning, when I wake up, I practice Phosphenic Mixing.<br \/>I feel calm and serene throughout the day. When I have to travel and suffer from jet lag, rhythmic breathing and head sways help me greatly to maintain a clear head and a high level of energy.<\/p>\n<p>My daughter uses Phosphenic Mixing to improve her studying of foreign languages and other subjects. She is in the sixth grade and believes her good results are due to the practice of Phosphenic Mixing. My son is in the fifth grade and since he has been using Phosphenic Mixing, his grades have improved, in all the subjects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Educational protocol<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1-\u00a0Observation of the phosphene with a description of the colors perceived<br \/>2-\u00a0Exercise of Phosphenic Mixing with a positive sentence<br \/>3-\u00a0Exercise of reading with the post-phosphene<br \/>4-\u00a0Test of comprehension and memorization<br \/>5-\u00a0\u201fStar phosphene\u201d: i.e. the patient focuses on the light bulb while moving their eyes up, down, left, right and following a diagonal that crosses the center<br \/>6-\u00a0I give a glass of alkaline ionized water to the patient<br \/>7-\u00a0I provide a lamp for practicing exercises at home<\/p>\n<p>Conclusion: For my part, I practice everyday different breathing exercises, head sways and mental imagery. My children have started practicing and introduce the method of learning with the phosphenes to their circle of friends.<br \/>With my patients, I use phosphenes systematically and I provide them with lamps and some practical information, according to their situation.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar orientation=&#8221;right&#8221; area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_9&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Click Image&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;|700|||||||&#8221; header_text_align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_7&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Understanding&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; width=&#8221;99.2%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;|26px||||&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.phosphenism.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Pratice-Phosphenim-1024&#215;576.jpg&#8221; title_text=&#8221;Pratice-Phosphenim&#8221; align=&#8221;center&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_cta title=&#8221;You too, learn how to transform Light Energy into Mental Energy, thanks to our many animations and 100% free videos. &#8221; button_url=&#8221;https:\/\/www.phosphenism.com\/method-phosphenic-mixing-applied-to-education\/&#8221; button_text=&#8221;Click Here&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#cc6600&#8243; custom_button=&#8221;on&#8221; button_text_size=&#8221;25px&#8221; button_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; button_border_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; button_icon=&#8221;%%20%%&#8221; width=&#8221;99.9%&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px||false|false&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"line-height: 20pt; color: #000000;\"><strong>4 videos<\/strong> (animations) to understand the practice of Phosphenic Mixing applied to Education<br \/><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>+<\/strong><\/span> <strong>18 videos<\/strong> about Individual Development<br \/><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>+<\/strong><\/span> <strong>5 vid\u00e9os<\/strong> about Initiatic Techniques<br \/><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>+<\/strong><\/span> Many videos about the Method presentation<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>[\/et_pb_cta][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Phosphenic Mixing is a potent and efficient technique for therapeutic treatment as well as for learning, for children and adults alike.I am a psychotherapist and I conduct training courses in the domain of human resources.Let me recount some of the applications I have used with with patients.
