A science, an art and a technique, geobiology studies various parameters stemming from the ground, the atmosphere or from forms that can be perceived by our sensitivity, like underground streams, geological faults, telluric networks, cosmo-telluric conduits, the sacred network, the Hartmann network, the Curry network\u2026 These networks form a more or less regular grid on the ground: in general, they consist in bands a few tens of centimeters wide that can sometimes be situated several meters apart.<\/p>\n<p>For the past 50\u00a0years, physicians, doctors and diviners have detected a certain influence of locations on the growth or the behavior of plants, trees, animals and people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The energies of the earth: telluric energy, cosmic energy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Everywhere on the planet, we are under the permanent influence of two massive energies that we cannot escape: telluric energy, which comes from the center of the earth and cosmic energy which comes from space.<\/p>\n<p>The earth needs the cosmic energy to achieve the distribution of the universal force, without which we would not exist. This distribution is made through networks that can be compared to our blood circulation system. The radiation of the earth has an influence on the cells of our bodies. the earth is alive thanks to its electromagnetic field. Without the cosmic rays that surround it, there would be no life on earth.<\/p>\n<p>For newcomers in geobiology, a sacred network is a network of energy fed by the sun when it is orientated on an east-west or north-south axis. 40 to 80\u00a0centimeters wide, it can reach 2\u00a0meters in certain places. It is called sacred because it can be found in all places of worship that were built before the 14th century. It connects them together. It is an extremely powerful network of positive energy.<\/p>\n<p>The companions, builders of cathedrals understood perfectly these networks of energy and knew how to use them in their works. All the great cathedrals were built on sacred networks. The understanding of these networks dates back to much more ancient times as standing stones and dolmens are almost always set up on these networks.<\/p>\n<p>Sacred geobiology is precisely the study of these ancient places of worship, built on telluric or solar networks. Like human beings, our old planet is also covered by many networks of energy. Our ancestors respected these networks and knew how to use them. Sadly, it is not the case today.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201fOn a purely energetic point of view, it seems that the location &#8211; whether of a standing stone or any other temple or shrine &#8211; is originally a bad choice, if only the telluric reading is taken into account. These locations are not suited for human beings to live without harm to their health. Nevertheless, it is on locations where the vibrations are disturbed that the ancients used to raise standing stones or build churches. It was their work that allowed the transformation of the negative energy of a location into an extremely positive and regenerating energy.\u201d (J.-L. Bovin,\u00a0M\u00e9galithes, Editions Mosa\u00efque).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The geobiological study of sacred places confers them a new dimension. By dint of patience, intuition and open-mindedness, it is possible to make fascinating discoveries. All churches are different because of their location and the intentions of the people who built them. The architectural elements can generally be deciphered on several levels: telluric, biblical and symbolic, as the architecture of these buildings matches the architecture of living beings: it is interactive and complex. Appreciating a place of power, is feeling its vibrations in the whole of one&#8217;s being and letting them awaken something has been left dormant\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Doctor Francis Lefebure, a French physician and scientist, designed a method of development of personal energy that he called Phosphenism. Practicing Phosphenism helps feeling the energy of a location. This method is based on the systematic use of the phosphenes. The phosphenes are all the subjective sensations of light, i.e. those which are not directly caused by light stimulating the retina. They can be produced by focusing shortly on a source of light.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An exercise of Phosphenism applied to geobiology:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Choose a location where a megalith has been installed (dolmen, menhir or cromlech). If you live in Western Europe there are many megalithic sites to visit, some of them are very famous like Stonehenge or Carnac.<\/p>\n<p>Sit down near that megalith, making sure you place your back against the menhir, the stone that constitutes the back of the dolmen or the central stone of the cromlech you have chosen.<\/p>\n<p>Do a phosphene. You can use the reflection of the sun on water or a white cloth or focus on the sun through a piece of fabric for one to two seconds (make sure you take your glasses or contacts off, as they could have a magnifying glass effect and burn your retina). You can also simply focus on bright clouds or, if you are sitting inside a dolmen, focus on the sky through the main opening of the dolmen during one to three minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Then, close your eyes and keep your attention focused on the subjective sensations that might appear.<br \/>Do another phosphene every time you think it is necessary (every 5 to 15\u00a0minutes, for example).<\/p>\n<p>Stay in this position for at least half an hour. After roughly a quarter of an hour, you will start to feel the energy of the place.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_sidebar orientation=&#8221;right&#8221; area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_9&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Click Image&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; header_font=&#8221;|700|||||||&#8221; header_text_align=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_sidebar area=&#8221;et_pb_widget_area_7&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;Sidebar Understanding&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; width=&#8221;99.2%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;|26px||||&#8221;][\/et_pb_sidebar][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_font_size=&#8221;10px&#8221; background_color=&#8221;#d3d3d3&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;10px|10px|10px|10px|false|false&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Importante Note<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have done our best to provide you with the most accurate translation of our french website.
